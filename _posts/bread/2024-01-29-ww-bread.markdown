This recipe makes 1 loaf of standard whole wheat bread, and is a staple in my freezer for sandwiches. The white vinegar gives it a slight sour flavor, without being too sour like sourdough for my taste. The bread is best served warm, and works great on a savory sandwich or a peanut butter and jelly. I always advocate for gram measurements instead of volume, and it is especially important when baking bread. Please use a scale for this, the volume measurements are just estimations. 

INGREDIENTS
- 360g (1 ½ cups) water, warm, 110F
- 10g (1 Tbsp) dry yeast
- 10g (½ Tbsp) honey, or sugar, optional
- 8g (1 ½ tsp) salt
- 10g (2 tsp) olive oil
- 5g (1 tsp) white vinegar, optional, or apple cider vinegar
- 420g (3 ½ cups) whole wheat flour
- 80g (¾ cup) vital wheat gluten

INSTRUCTIONS
- Add honey, yeast, salt, and warm water to a large mixing bowl, and mix. Let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the yeast is still alive
