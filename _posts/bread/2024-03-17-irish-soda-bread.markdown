Description: This Irish Soda Bread is healthier than traditional, as it's packed with much more fiber and nutrients due to the whole wheat and oat flours. This is a quick bread recipe that relies on the reaction between baking soda and buttermilk, giving you a delicious bread in a fraction of the time. It goes great with my <a href="shepards-pie">Cauliflower Mash Shepard's Pie</a> for a hearty dinner
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 450F, and take out a large cookie sheet. Lightly grease it with oil. For a crispier crust, you can instead bake on a preheated pizza stone. Just use parchment paper, so it's easier to get the loaf in<br><br>

- Combine all the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl - oat flour, whole wheat flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk and egg until well combined<br><br>

- Pour the wet mixture into the dry. Using a wooden spoon, gently stir the mixture until a dough forms. Be careful not to overmix<br><br>

- Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead it gently a few times to shape it into a round circle. Place the shaped dough into the prepared skillet or baking pan<br><br>

- Using a sharp knife, score a cross on the top of the dough. This helps the bread expand while baking<br><br>

- Bake in the preheated 450F oven for 10 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 400F, and continue baking for another 35-40 minutes, or until the bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom<br><br>

- Remove from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for a few minutes. Transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing<br><br>

- Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2-3 days, or freeze for longer storage
