Description: Everybody loves pizza right? This is a 2 day process, but totally worth it for a good homemade pizza, plus it's a fun activity to do with a few people. Prep the dough the night before, and then have a few people over the next day for dinner. Whole wheat flour serves to add some extra nutrition and taste to your pizza as well.
Instructions: 
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the water, yeast, salt, and honey. Stir, and let sit for 5 minutes to make sure the yeast is alive<br><br>

- To the bowl, add the oil, and flours. Mix with a dough scraper and lightly knead in the bowl

- Cover with a cloth and let rest for 1 hour.<br><br>

- In the bowl, fold the dough into a smooth ball, and place back in the bowl. Cover and let rest for another 1 hour. Repeat one more time. (Total of 3 1 hour rests with stretch and fold)<br><br>

- Turn dough onto the table. Divide into 4 equal pieces (about 145 g), and shape into balls. Place dough balls in lightly oiled bowls, and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until dinner tomorrow night

- Place baking stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500F, or as high as your oven goes. Preheat stone for an hour<br><br>

- Shape dough into pizzas. Top with sauce, cheese, and toppings. Bake for 6-7 minutes<br><br>

- Remove from oven and cut into 4 slices<br><br>
