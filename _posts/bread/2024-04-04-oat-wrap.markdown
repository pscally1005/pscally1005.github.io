Description: These super simple oat flour wraps contain just 3 ingredients, and can be used as a healthy tortilla or crepe. They're gluten free and oil free, great for both tacos and chocolate. For savory fillings such as my <a href="spaghetti-taco">Spaghetti Tacos with Zoodles</a>, add some garlic and onion powder. For sweet fillings, add some cinnamon and vanilla
Instructions: 
- Add ingredients in to a food processor. Allow to soak for 15-30 minutes before blending until smooth<br><br>

- Preheat your pan over medium heat. Pour batter in center the center of the pan. Rotate pan to create an even circle.<br><br>

- Allow to cook until top bubbles and looks dry (1-2 minutes). Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the other side<br><br>
