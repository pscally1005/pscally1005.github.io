Description: Cloud bread is a low carb bread substitute made with whipped egg whites. It's lower in calories and higher in protein than regular bread, and it can be made in just a few minutes. It can be even lower in fat and calories if you omit the yolks, but I choose not to as egg yolks are still highly nutritious; plus what would I do with the extra yolk then? Just 1 egg is enough 2 small slices for a sandwich, or one large flatbread for a pizza
Instructions: 
- Separate your egg yolks from the whites. Add the whites to a large metal or glass bowl. Not plastic, or the egg whites won't beat properly. Carton egg whites are not recommended as those are harder to beat as well<br><br>

- Add baking powder and baking soda to the egg whites. Using a hand mixer, whip to form stuff peaks<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, to the yolks, add garlic powder, onion, powder, salt, and yogurt. Mix together with a spatula<br><br>

- Carefully fold the egg whites into the yolks.<br><br>

- Scoop the batter into a parchment lined baking pan, forming 6 equal sized disks (or 3 larger ones for a pizza)<br><br>

- Bake for 26 minutes in a preheated 300F oven. While the pizza is bigger, it's also a bit thinner, so both the pizza and the smaller bread should take the same time. Let cool totally on the pan before removing<br><br>

- To reheat for a pizza, top with sauce, cheese, and toppings, and bake at 400F for 5 minutes until warm and melty.  The sauce here is my <a href="avocado-pesto">Avocado Pesto - Vegan and Oil Free</a><br><br>
