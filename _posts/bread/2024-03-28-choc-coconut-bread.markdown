Description: This is a spin on my coconut flour loaf that I made a few days ago, that I instead wanted to make into a sweet bread. I've opted for chocolate protein powder here instead of unflavored, as well as removed the garlic and cut down the salt. Yes you read this right, there's still cheese! Trust me, it still tastes great, and the cheese is very helpful in developing the structure of the bread.

Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 350F, and line a 9x5" pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients - coconut flour, whey, baking powder, and salt. Make sure everything is fully mixed and there are no clumps of baking powder.  I've used chocolate protein powder here, but vanilla or unflavored would work as well.  If using unflavored, you can add your own sweetener to taste<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, beat together the eggs, vanilla, water, applesauce, and mozzarella cheese.  A mashed overripe banana would work great here in place of applesauce.  Just make sure the banana is fully mashed (or blended would be better)<br><br>

- Pour the wet into the dry, and mix until well combined. If the batter is too thick, add water 1 tbsp at a time. The batter should be thick but scoopable.  Transfer to your prepared bread pan<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 40-45 minutes, until the top is just firm to the touch.  A toothpick should come out totally clean, and the internal temperature should register about 205F<br><br>

- Remove from the oven, and let cool in the pan for 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack in the fridge to totally cool before slicing<br><br>
