Description: This pizza dough is a variation of the viral 2 ingredient dough, a combination of just yogurt and self rising flour (flour + baking powder + salt). Whole wheat flour is the best for its nutrition and taste, and the added spices add a lot to the flavor of the dough. Top if with a no sugar added sauce and a bit of cheese, and you have a healthy pizza with a decent bit of protein
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients - whole wheat flour, vital wheat gluten (or sub more flour), baking powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt. Add in the yogurt, and combine with your hands until you have a smooth dough ball<br><br>

- For a gluten free version, you can replace the whole wheat flour and vital wheat gluten with oat flour (40 g). The dough will be a little drier and crumblier because of the lack of gluten, but it can still be shaped into a flatbread<br><br>

- Flatten into a round and thin pizza dough. Top with your sauce, cheese, and any other toppings you like (meat and vegetables are great additions)<br><br>

- You can either bake this in a 500F oven on a preheated pizza stone for about 5-7 minutes, or you can cook it in a pan over medium heat (covered) until the bottom is browned to your liking (about 10 minutes)
