Description: Salmon is my preferred fish, but I don't tend to have it too often because it's fairly expensive. I always pick it up when on sale though, because it's a fantastic source of Omega-3s. These simply baked fillets are made in just a few minutes, and pair great with a crunchy salad, consisting of seasoned raw peppers, onions, and tomatoes.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 400F and line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Lightly grease the foil<br><br>

- Add your salmon to the pan, and season the top and sides with garlic, onion, and lemon pepper, or any other desired seasinings<br><br>

- Bake at 400F for about 14 minutes, or until the thickest part reaches 145F. Squeeze on some lemon juice.<br><br>

- As the fish cooks, wash and cut your vegetables, and add to a medium bowl. Season and mix to make your crunchy salad<br><br>
