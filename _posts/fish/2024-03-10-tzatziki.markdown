Description: Lemon and salmon go great together, one of my favorite combinations. I've also made a side of tzatziki sauce here, as well as some roasted brussel sprouts. This is a great light and healthy summery meal with plenty of Greek flavors
Instructions: 
- Starting with the Tzatziki. Finely dice your cucumber, and add to a strainer with salt. Let sit for about an hour to draw out excess water<br><br>

- To a medium bowl, combine the cucumber, yogurt, lemon juice, minced garlic, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use<br><br>

- Moving on to the brussel sprouts. Preheat your oven to 400F, and prepare a large cookie sheet with parchment or a silicone liner<br><br>

- Roast at 400F for about 30 minutes, or until lightly charred on the outside and tender in the center. Squeeze on some lemon or lime juice when done roasting<br><br>

- Finally, the salmon. In a small bowl, mix together lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Rub onto each piece of salmon<br><br>

- Cut your sprouts in half, and add to the tray. Season with oil, garlic, onion, salt, and pepper, and toss together with your hands<br><br>

- Roast the salmon for 10-14 minutes at 400F, or until done to your liking. I like my salmon fully cooked, so I prefer the higher end of that range and an internal temperature of about 145F, but you might like less<br><br>
