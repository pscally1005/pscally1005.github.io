Description: This "recipe" (if you can even call it that) was taken from Genius Kitchen, and consists of just a sliced avocado and a drained can of sardines. This brain bowl is a great meal or large snack that's high in omega-3s, monounsaturated fat, lutein, zeaxanthin, and fiber making it nourishing for both your stomach and your brain
Instructions: 
- Cut your avocado into slices, and add to the base of a bowl. Roughly drain your sardines, and add on top of the avocado. Squeeze on some lemon/lime juice, and top with everything bagel seasoning
