Description: Fra Diavolo sauce is a Christmas classic for me, and was always served over spinach and shrimp, two of my favorite foods. Here, I mixed the spinach right into the sauce, and you can put it on whatever you want, such as chicken if you're not a seafood fan.
Instructions: 
- In a medium saucepot, sauteed oil, garlic, and spinach over medium heat for about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Add in tomatoes and seasonings for the sauce (Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic and onion powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes).  Mix, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 1 hour, uncovered<br><br>

- The shrimp will take just a few minutes to cook, so start it when the sauce is almost done. Heat garlic and oil in a large nonstick pan over medium heat<br><br>

- In a large bowl, add your shrimp and seasonings (Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder, lemon pepper, and paprika). If your shrimp isn't already peeled and deveined, make sure to do that first. Remove the tails too. Mix the shrimp with the spices<br><br>

- Add to a pan and cook for 2-3 minutes each side, or until they turn from gray to pink<br><br>

- Serve the shrimp and sauce with pasta if desired
