Description: Fish and Chips is a classic British meal that consists of breaded and deep fried fish, served with a side of French fries, or chips as they would be called across the pond. To make it a more nutritious meal, I've breaded my fish in gluten free oat flour, and cooked both the fish and the potatoes in my air fryer. For even more nutrients (and taste imo), I've used sweet potato here too.
Instructions: 
- Starting with the "chips". Wash (but don't peel) your sweet potato, and cut into a French fry shape. Add to a medium microwave safe bowl, cover with a plate, and microwave on high for 3 minutes<br><br>

- Toss the fries with the oil, garlic, onion, paprika, salt, and pepper<br><br>

- Preheat your air fryer to 400F, and lightly spray the basket with oil. Add in the fries, and air fry for about 6 minutes<br><br>

- Moving on to the fish. Lightly coat the fish in olive oil<br><br>

- In a small bowl, mix together the breading ingredients of oat flour and spices (lemon pepper, thyme, and chili powder)<br><br>

- Coat the fish in your breading. Lightly spray the basket with oil, and add to the air fryer. Lightly spray the top, and air fry for about 6 minutes at 400F<br><br>

- The fish and chips should take the same time to cook, so you can do them together next to each other. That's why this recipe is only 1 serving, as the air fryer can only fit one portion at a time. If you want to scale this up, I would recommend tripling it (3 servings), and doing the fries first. Transfer the fries to a wire rack to stay crisp, and then cook your 3 fish filets<br><br>
