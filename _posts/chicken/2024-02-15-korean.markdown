Description: This Korean style chicken mixes together roasted broccoli and sauteed sweet potatoes, and is served with a soy sauce and chili paste sauce. The chicken is roasted in the oven, and then diced up into the same size as everything else, and it all comes together in a wok. This is a great all together meal to feed multiple people, and has some spice to it.
Instructions: 
- A few hours before you plan to cook, cut up the chicken into thin cutlets, pounding with a meat mallet to even thickness. Salt, pepper, and oil both sides to dry brine the meat, and let the chicken rest uncovered on a baking tray in the fridge for about 4 hours<br><br>

- Preheat oven to 400F.  Finely dice the onion , and cut up your frozen broccoli into bite sized pieces. You can let the broccoli defrost for a few hours on the counter, or microwave it until soft. Also cut up the sweet potatoes into roughly the same size as the broccoli. Don't peel the potatoes, but make sure to wash them<br><br>

- Add broccoli to a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper<br><br>

- Roast the vegetables for about 30 minutes. With 12 minutes left on the vegetables, place the chicken in the oven. They will be done at the same time. Be careful to not overcook the chicken since it will cook some more in the sauce<br><br>

- Transfer potatoes and onion to a large wok. Season with salt, pepper, and oil, and saute over medium high heat (covered with foil) until cooked to your desired texture. You should be doing the potatoes while the broccoli and soon to be chicken are in the oven. Everything should finish around the same time. If the potatoes are done earlier, simply take them off the heat. Go light with the seasoning here, since the sauce will be coming. You can adjust any flavors as you desire after the sauce has been mixed in<br><br>

- Meanwhile, mix together the sauce in a large glass - gochujang, soy sauce, water, garlic powder, ginger, and cornstarch<br><br>

- When the food is done cooking, cut up the chicken into roughly the same sized pieces as the broccoli, onions, and sweet potatoes. Transfer everything to the wok with the potatoes, and mix with the sauce, cooking for about a minute on medium. Because of the cornstarch, the sauce with thicken as it is heated. Adjust seasoning as needed, and serve
