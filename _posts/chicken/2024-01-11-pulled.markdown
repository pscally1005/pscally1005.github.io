Description: This BBQ pulled chicken is made easy in a slow cooker, and features a homemade <a href="bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a>. I paired it with a side of oil and vinegar coleslaw (not a mayo based coleslaw), and can be easily made into a sandwich. I always hated shredding cabbage, until I realized I could use my food processor to do the work for me. Give it a go, and check out the homemade sauce, or use your own BBQ sauce
Instructions: 
- Place the chicken into a large slow cooker. Add spices (chili powder, paprika, garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne) over the chicken, and mix to evenly coat it all<br><br>

- Add half of your BBQ sauce on top of the chicken. The other half of the BBQ sauce will be reserved for at the end<br><br>

- Cover, and cook on low for 4-6 hours, or until the chicken is at least 185F and shreds easily<br><br>

- Transfer the chicken to a cutting board or bowl, and shred with 2 forks (or your hands). Return the chicken to the slow cooker<br><br>

- Heat the remainder of your BBQ sauce and soy sauce in the microwave for about a minute until warm, and pour over your shredded chicken<br><br>

- The coleslaw can be made at any time and kept in the fridge, so I like to do it as the chicken cooks. I find that a food processor is the easiest way to shred cabbage. Cut your cabbage into wedges and remove the core. Using the shredder attachment, feed the cabbage down the tube to finely shred it. You can also use a mandolin or a knife. Transfer the shredded cabbage to a large bowl<br><br>

- In a glass, mix together the dressing ingredients (ACV, oil, lime, soy sauce, balsamic, dijon, onion and garlic powder, black pepper, and celery seed). Pour over the cabbage, mix, and serve<br>
