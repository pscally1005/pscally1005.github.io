Description: A quick caprese chicken is one of my favorites, as I can simply bake the chicken, and make a tomato and balsamic sauce while it's in the oven. The flavor combination of cooked tomatoes with balsamic vinegar is a staple in Italian cooking for a reason. Especially when topped with cheese, this recipe makes a great main to a side of roasted artichokes
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse your artichokes, and add to a large bowl. Season (vinegar, minced garlic, oil, basil, garlic powder, and lemon pepper), and transfer to an 8" square baking pan lined with aluminum foil<br><br>

- Roast at 400F for about 25-30 minutes, or until done to your liking.<br><br>

- As the artichokes cook, start on the chicken. Cut up the tomatoes, and set aside. Cut the chicken into cutlets, about 3-4 per chicken breast. Pound the chicken to even thickness if necessary<br><br>

- In a large bowl, combine the chicken with the seasonings (oil, vinegar, basil, and salt). Mix with your hands, and place onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-14 minutes at 400F, or until just 165F, not any over<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a large pan over medium heat, add balsamic vinegar to the skillet, and add garlic and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute). Add in the tomatoes and basil, and cook until the chicken is done, stirring occasionally<br><br>

- Return chicken to skillet and nestle with tomatoes. Top each piece of chicken with cheese, and cover the skillet to melt the cheese. Cover and cook for an additional minute until the cheese is melted, and serve<br><br>
