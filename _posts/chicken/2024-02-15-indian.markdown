Description: This recipe utilizes a yogurt marinade with some Indian spices to give this very simple orange looking chicken its great flavor. I've paired it with roasted sweet potatoes to keep it color consistent, but swap in any other vegetable or side that you desire
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 400F, and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper (one for the chicken, the other for the potatoes)<br><br>

- Wash and cut the sweet potatoes into a medium dice. Add to a bowl, and toss with the seasonings (salsa, hot sauce, oil, minced garlic, grated cheese, chili powder, pepper, onion powder, and salt)<br><br>

- Transfer to a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 400F for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until the outsides are crispy, the insides are soft, and they are browned to your liking<br><br>

- Meanwhile, prepare the chicken. In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, oil, minced garlic, and spices (cumin, paprika, tumeric, garlic and onion powder, ginger, salt, and cayenne)<br><br>

- Trim excess fat off the chicken and add to the bowl. Mix to coat<br><br>

- Transfer the chicken to a pan. Optionally, you can marinate the chicken for a few hours in the bowl, or on the pan<br><br>

- Bake at 400F for 12-14 minutes, or until the chicken just reaches 165F. Flip about halfway through. Start the chicken so that way it finishes at the same time as the potatoes
