Description: An Italian style breaded chicken that's both gluten free and not deep fried sounds like a dream come true. This dish is elevated even more when made into Chicken Parmesan. It goes well with a side of Brushetta mix, either on its own or on a slice of toasted Italian bread
Instructions:
- Cut the chicken into cutlets. Make each piece even thickness by adding it to a bag and smashing it down to make it wide and thin. Sprinkle each side with salt. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour<br><br>

- Preheat oven (or air fryer) to 400F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and some spray<br><br>

- On a plate, measure out the flour. Add the garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and oregano to the plate and mix<br><br>

- To a medium bowl, add in the egg and water and beat the egg<br><br>

- To a separate plate, add the breadcrumb mix - oat flour, grated cheese, thyme, basil, salt, and pepper<br><br>

- In order, coat the chicken in the flour, egg, and breadcrumb mixes. Add it to the pan.<br><br>

- Cook the chicken, flipping and rotating racks halfway, or until the chicken is at least 165F. Bake in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400F, or in the air fryer for about 8 minutes at 400F<br><br>

- Optional (Chicken Parm) - add sauce (about 1/2 cup or 200 g for the whole batch) and cheese (about 3/4 cup or 150 g for the whole batch) to the top of the chicken, and broil until the cheese is melted (about 2 minutes). 

- Note - DO NOT USE PARCHMENT PAPER FOR CHICKEN PARM. IT WILL BURN UNDER THE BROILER Leave the door open a little for an electric oven<br><br>

- As the chicken cooks, you can make the Brushetta topping. Finely dice the tomatoes, and add to a medium bowl. Season, and optionally serve on a slice of toasted bread, or spoon on top of the chicken<br><br>
