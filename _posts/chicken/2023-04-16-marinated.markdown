Description: Grilled chicken was something that my parents always had prepared in the freezer. They'd simply marinate a package of chicken in a Ziploc bag, and freeze it for a busy night. I've taken inspiration from that recipe, but I bake them since I live in an apartment, but grilling would be ideal. These chickens go great with virtually any side, but especially anything grilled as well, like some grilled or roasted zucchini, or here I air fryed a plantian.
Instructions:
- Slice each chicken breast into 2-3 cutlets. Evenly thin out the chicken, and pound it down if needed<br><br>

- Add spices (Italian seasoning, paprika, cumin, chili and onion powder, black pepper, soy sauce, lemon juice, and olive oil) and chicken to a Ziploc bag, shake until chicken is well coated. Can marinate in the fridge for a few hours or up to a day in you want<br><br>

- Grill on a grill pan or bake in the oven (400F, 12-14 minutes)<br><br>

- For your plantains, preheat your air fryer to 370F. Use a knife to peel the plantain keeping it in one piece. Air fry for 16 minutes, filling halfway<br><br>

- Remove to a cutting board and slice. Lightly sprinkle with salt, and serve
