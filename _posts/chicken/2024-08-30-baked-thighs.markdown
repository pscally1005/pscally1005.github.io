Description: These baked chicken thighs are dead simple to make and taste great. Just mix spices in a bowl, dump over chicken, and stick in the oven. I've gone with thighs today to mix it up, but chicken breasts would also work (just reduce the time)
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 400F, and line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a small bowl, mix together your spices - paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, thyme, and salt<br><br>

- Add your chicken thighs to a large bowl with lemon juice. Add the whole spice mix on top, and mix until fully coated. Transfer to your baking sheet<br><br>

- Roast at 400F for about 30 minutes, or until the thighs are between 175F and 185F<br><br>

- You can use chicken breasts instead, but you'll need to reduce the time. Roast at 400F until the breasts reach 165F, about 15 minutes<br><br>

- You can eat them as a standalone piece of meat on your plate, but today I decided to chop up the baked pieces and use them in place of ground turkey in my <a href="/recipes/penne-casserole">Penne and Meat Casserole Bake</a><br><br>
