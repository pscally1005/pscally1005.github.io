Description: This Crockpot stew is a perfect dump and go recipe, like my <a href="/recipes/peanut-chicken-chili">Peanut Chicken Chili</a> and <a href="/recipes/chicken-noodle-stew">Chicken Noodle Stew</a>; meaning you just have to cut up the vegetables and chicken, add it to the crockpot, and have dinner ready for you. No other cooking required!. Add all the vegetables, chicken, and spices raw, and just forget about it until dinner time. This hearty meal is great during a cold winter. Chicken thighs work the best here for the long cooking time, as they won't dry out like chicken breast would.
Instructions:
- Cut the peppers and onions into a medium dice, and cut your frozen (and defrosted) broccoli into a similar size.  Dice the chicken into bite sized cubes.  Add all ingredients into the crockpot and mix<br><br>

- Cook on low for about 6 hours, or until chicken is fully cooked. Optionally serve with some cheese and rice<br><br>
