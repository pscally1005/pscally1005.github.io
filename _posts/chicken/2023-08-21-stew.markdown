Description: This Crockpot stew is a perfect dump and go recipe. Add all the vegetables, chicken, and spices raw, and just forget about it until dinner time. This hearty meal is great during a cold winter. Chicken thighs work the best here for the long cooking time, as they won't dry out like chicken breast would.
Instructions:
- Cut the peppers and onions into a medium dice, and cut your frozen (and defrosted) broccoli into a similar size.  Dice the chicken into bite sized cubes.  Add all ingredients into the crockpot and mix<br><br>

- Cook on low for 5-6 hours, or until chicken is fully cooked. Optionally serve with some cheese<br><br>
