Description: It might be summer, but I'm gearing up for winter. And that means immune boosting delicious stews to keep you warm and help cure your common cold. This remix off the classic Chicken Noodle Soup is packed with more vegetables and anti-inflammatory spices. The combination of ginger, turmeric, garlic, cayenne pepper, and more will leave your taste buds satisfied, belly fully, and nose cleared.  It's a dump and go stew, like my <a href="/recipes/chicken-stew">Crockpot Chicken Stew</a> and <a href="/recipes/peanut-chicken-chili">Peanut Chicken Chili</a>; meaning you just have to cut up the vegetables and chicken, add it to the crockpot, and have dinner ready for you. No other cooking required!
Instructions: 
- Cut your onion, carrots, and celery into a small dice, and add to a large slow cooker. Dump in your bag of defrosted broccoli. Finely cut your ginger, and add to the pot as well with your minced garlic<br><br>

- Add your pasta to the pot as well. Whole wheat, egg noodles, gluten free pasta, chickpea pasta, or red lentil pasta are all good choices.  Putting the pasta in raw now will cause it to disintegrate and fully mix into the stew, which I'm honestly a fan of.  But if you want the pasta pices to be distinct and together, I'd recommend leaving it out here.  Instead, cook the pasta as directed on the box with 30 minutes left on the stew, and mix in the cooked pasta right at the end<br><br>

- Cut your chicken thighs into bite sized pieces, and add to the pot<br><br>

- Add in your soy sauce, chicken bouillon, dried spices (thyme, garlic, onion, cumin, black pepper, allspice, turmeric, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne), and water. Mix everything together<br><br>

- Cover and cook on low for about 6 hours, or until the chicken is at least 180F, and the vegetables are tender.  Stir in lemon juice, and serve
