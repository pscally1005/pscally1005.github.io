Description: My favorite thing about this Chicken Florentine is that it tastes just as good as all the others I've had, but without the addition of all the heavy cream that would normally turn this into a fat bomb. Packed with chicken and spinach, and made creamy with a secret ingredient, this recipe is amazing, and goes great with a side of brown rice or roasted vegetables
Instructions:
- Cook the frozen spinach, onion, and spices (salt, pepper, garlic, italian seasoning, onion powder, and paprika) in a large pan on medium heat until fully cooked. Set aside on a plate<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a medium pot, add the chicken broth. YOu can also use 3/4 tsp bouillon powder and 3/4 cup (180 g) of water in place of the broth.  Cover and let simmer on medium until liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- To a small bowl whisk milk and cornstarch and mix until there are no more clumps. Pour in the pot<br><br>

- Add the cottage cheese into the sauce pot and combine. Cover and simmer the sauce while you prepare the chicken<br><br>

- Meanwhile, dice the chicken into small cubes. Over medium heat in the pan, cook the chicken and spices (oil, salt, italian seasoning, onion and garlic powder, pepper, and basil)<br><br>

- When chicken is almost done, add the plate of spinach and pot of sauce to the pan and combine. Cook on medium heat until liquid has reduced and chicken is done. You want the sauce to be creamy, but not too liquidy where itâ€™s runny. Serve
