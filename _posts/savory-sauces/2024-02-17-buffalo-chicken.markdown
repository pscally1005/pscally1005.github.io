Description: This buffalo chicken dip is great for your raw vegetables, crackers, or chips, tastes better than the original, and won't leave you feeling sick from all the cream cheese. I cut back on the cheese, and added some additional spices and also some roasted carrots for extra flavor and nutrition. The Super Bowl was a few days ago, so I'm a bit late, but whatever.  Other great gameday dips are <a href="spinach-artichoke-dip">High Protein Spinach Artichoke Dip</a> and <a href="french-onion-dip">Low Fat French Onion Dip</a>, which I highly recommend
Instructions: 
- Heat your oven to 400F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment. Cut your carrots into strips, and add to the pan. Season with salts and olive oil, and roast for 25-30 minutes. Transfer to a food processor, blend until finely chopped, and set aside<br><br>

- Lower your oven to 350F, and spray an 8" square pan with oil<br><br>

- For the chicken, I like to buy a store bought cooked rotisserie chicken, and shred it with my hands. It's cheaper and easier, and I can save all the unused bits for a stock. You can probably also get away with 2 12.5 oz cans (drained and rinsed) of chicken, or you can also cook your own chicken and shred it.  I would aim for about 2 cups (250 g) of cooked shredded chicken<br><br>

- Mix all ingredients (shredded chicken, hot sauce, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheddar cheese, minced garlic, dijon mustard, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper) together in a large bowl except the parsley and parmesan cheese<br><br>

- Transfer the dip to the pan, and top with your remaining cheese, as well as the parsley. Bake at 350F for 25 minutes (covered). Broil the top for a few minutes to brown the cheese if desired, and serve warm<br><br>

- Note - typically buffalo chicken dip is cooked, but honestly I think I prefer it "raw", as it's creamier. It's up to you
