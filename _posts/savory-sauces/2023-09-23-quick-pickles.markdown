Description: Quick pickles add a great color and flavor pop to nearly every dish, and red onions are my personal favorite vegetable for this. Simply cover with water and vinegar in a mason jar, and you're done!
Instructions: 
- Cut the red onions into long thin strips and add to a mason jar. Season with salt and minced garlic. Pour in vinegar and water. The onions should be just covered, about half water to half vinegar. Let pickle in the fridge for at least a few days before eating<br><br>
