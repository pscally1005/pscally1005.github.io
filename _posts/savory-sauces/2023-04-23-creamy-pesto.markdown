Description: This pesto is more of a spread than a sauce, and is my personal favorite for dipping raw vegetables or for spreading on a sandwich. I also love it as the main <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#sauces">sauce</a> on my pizza, which you can see in my <a href="pizza">Home Oven Baked Pizza</a>.  It's made creamy by swapping olive oil for cottage cheese, which is honestly way better than it sounds. I know you're probably scared of cottage cheese reading through many of these recipes, but honestly give it a shot, you'll be surprised. Each serving is about 40g<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other pesto recipes, with varying amounts of oil, different kinds of nuts, vegan versions, and high protein versions:<br>- <a href="/recipes/oil-free-basil-pesto">Oil Free Basil Pesto</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/avocado-pesto">Avocado Pesto - Vegan and Oil Free</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/evoo-pesto">Lightened Extra Virgin Olive Oil Pesto</a>
Instructions: 
- Toast the nuts over medium heat in a dry pan for 2-3 minutes.  Any nuts will work here - almonds, peanuts, pistachios, etc., or none if you have a nut allergy<br><br>

- Add the nuts, cheeses, spinach, garlic and salt to a food processor. Blend on high until everything is finely blended, about 45 seconds. Scrape down the sides if needed<br><br>

- Add in the cottage cheese and blend until fully combined. Season with salt to taste.  Transfer to a mason jar and store in the fridge for up to a few days
