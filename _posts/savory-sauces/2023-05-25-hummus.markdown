Description: Hummus is a staple in my fridge.  It's so easy to make, very nutritious, and tastes great on just about anything.  I've omitted the oil, and chosen to use homemade cashew butter instead of tahini, but any nut or seed butter will work here.  If you like the classic tahini though, go for it!  Each serving is about 2 tbsp or 30 g<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other flavors of hummus as well!  They're all either contain either low or no oil, making them lower in fat and calories than traditional.  I have plenty of differnent flavors coming from various spices, roasted vegetables, differnet nut and seed butters, and even different beans:<br>- <a href="/recipes/classic-tahini-hummus">Classic Tahini Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-red-pepper-hummus">Roasted Red Pepper Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-garlic-hummus">Cheesy Garlic Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-hummus">Golden Sweet Potato Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/ginger-hummus">Ginger Lime Black Bean Hummus</a>
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse the chickpeas.  Blend up chickpeas in a food processor with the nut butter, lemon juice, and garlic<br><br>

- Once fully blended, add the spices (cumin, chili, paprika, onion, pepper, and salt) and blend until well mixed<br><br>

- Optionally top with everything bagel seasoning. Transfer to a Tupperware and store in the fridge
