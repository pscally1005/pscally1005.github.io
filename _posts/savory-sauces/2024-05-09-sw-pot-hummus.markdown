Description: After making my <a href="air-fried-falafel">ðŸ§† Air Fryer Falafel (GF) ðŸ¥™</a>, I realized that sweet potato and chickpeas are a fantastic combination.  This sweet potato hummus combines the two together perfectly, and has the addition of anti-inflammatory spices, such as ginger, turmeric, and cinnamon.  It's creamy and delicious on a salad or wrap, has a great orange hue, and is high in fiber while being lower in fat than store-bought hummus
Instructions: 
- Wash your sweet potato with a brush, and prick with a fork. Wrap in aluminum foil, and air fry at 400F for 1 hour. Slice open to let steam out as you prepare the rest of the ingredients<br><br>

- Drain and rinse your chickpeas using a strainer. Add to a large food processor with sweet potato (including the skin!), lemon, garlic, and nut butter.  I've used pistachio butter here, but you can use almond butter, tahini, or any other natural nut/seed butter you have. Blend until smooth<br><br>

- Add in your spices, and blend to fully combine. Adjust anything to taste, and store in the fridge
