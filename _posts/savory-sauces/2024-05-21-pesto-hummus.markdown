Description: I love making pesto, and I love making hummus. I have a few variations of either posted here, but now it's time that I combined my 2 favorite spreads and sauces together. The combination of roasted garlic, toasted pine nuts, and cheese pairs perfectly with the chickpeas and lemon juice. It's also higher in protein from the cottage cheese, which also makes it super creamy.  Nutrition facts are for a 2 tbsp (33 g) serving<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other flavors of hummus as well!  They're all either contain either low or no oil, making them lower in fat and calories than traditional.  I have plenty of differnent flavors coming from various spices, roasted vegetables, differnet nut and seed butters, and even different beans:<br>- <a href="/recipes/classic-tahini-hummus">Classic Tahini Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-red-pepper-hummus">Roasted Red Pepper Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-garlic-hummus">Cheesy Garlic Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-hummus">Golden Sweet Potato Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/ginger-hummus">Ginger Lime Black Bean Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/hummus">Lemony Taco Inspired Hummus</a><br>&emsp;Check out some of my other pesto recipes, with varying amounts of oil, different kinds of nuts, vegan versions, and high protein versions:<br>- <a href="/recipes/oil-free-basil-pesto">Oil Free Basil Pesto</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/avocado-pesto">Avocado Pesto - Vegan and Oil Free</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/evoo-pesto">Lightened Extra Virgin Olive Oil Pesto</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto">Creamy Pesto Dip</a>
Instructions: 
- Slice the top off the garlic, lightly coat in oil, wrap in aluminum foil, and air fry at 400F for 25 minutes, or until soft and caramelized, but not burned.  You could also roast in the oven for 45 minutes.  Allow to cool before squeezing the garlic into a food processor.  Alternatively, you can use raw garlic, but reduce to only about 2 cloves instead of the whole bulb.<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a small pan, toast the nuts over medium heat for about 3 minutes, or until they start to brown lightly.  Add to the food processor<br><br>

- To your food processor, combine together the garlic, nuts, spinach, (drained and rinsed) chickpeas, lemon juice, grated cheese, vinegar, and nutritional yeast.  Blend until everything is fully chopped<br><br>

- Add in the cottage cheese, and blend until smooth.  Blend in your spices, season with salt to taste, and transfer to an airtight container to store in the fridge
