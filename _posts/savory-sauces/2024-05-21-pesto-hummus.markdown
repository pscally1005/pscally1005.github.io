Description: I love making pesto, and I love making hummus. I have a few variations of either posted here, but now it's time that I combined my 2 favorite spreads and sauces together. The combination of roasted garlic, toasted pine nuts, and cheese pairs perfectly with the chickpeas and lemon juice. It's also higher in protein from the cottage cheese, which also makes it super creamy.  Nutrition facts are for a 2 tbsp (33 g) serving
Instructions: 
- Slice the top off the garlic, lightly coat in oil, wrap in aluminum foil, and air fry at 400F for 25 minutes, or until soft and caramelized, but not burned.  You could also roast in the oven for 45 minutes.  Allow to cool before squeezing the garlic into a food processor.  Alternatively, you can use raw garlic, but reduce to only about 2 cloves instead of the whole bulb.<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a small pan, toast the nuts over medium heat for about 3 minutes, or until they start to brown lightly.  Add to the food processor<br><br>

- To your food processor, combine together the garlic, nuts, spinach, (drained and rinsed) chickpeas, lemon juice, grated cheese, vinegar, and nutritional yeast.  Blend until everything is fully chopped<br><br>

- Add in the cottage cheese, and blend until smooth.  Blend in your spices, season with salt to taste, and transfer to an airtight container to store in the fridge
