Description: I love hummus; it's easily my favorite dip for vegetables and dressing for salad. Lately I've been experimenting with other flavors, so I've made this roasted beet hummus. Check out my <a href="roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a> as well, which is equally as delicious
Instructions: 
- Cut the ends off your beets, wrap in aluminum foil, and bake wrapped beets at 400F for 40 mins or until a knife goes through with ease<br><br>
