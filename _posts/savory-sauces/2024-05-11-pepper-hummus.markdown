Description: I've always loved both roasted red peppers and roasted pepper hummus, so I finally gave it a shot here. The peppers add a great smokey and sweet flavor to the hummus, as well as a delicious orange color. It's mildly spicy from the cayenne, and works great on top of salads<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other flavors of hummus as well!  They're all either contain either low or no oil, making them lower in fat and calories than traditional.  I have plenty of differnent flavors coming from various spices, roasted vegetables, differnet nut and seed butters, and even different beans:<br>- <a href="/recipes/classic-tahini-hummus">Classic Tahini Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-garlic-hummus">Cheesy Garlic Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-hummus">Golden Sweet Potato Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/ginger-hummus">Ginger Lime Black Bean Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/hummus">Lemony Taco Inspired Hummus</a>
