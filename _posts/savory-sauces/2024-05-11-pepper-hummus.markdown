Description: I've always loved both roasted red peppers and roasted pepper hummus, so I finally gave it a shot here. The peppers add a great smokey and sweet flavor to the hummus, as well as a delicious orange color. It's mildly spicy from the cayenne, and works great on top of salads. I've made this alongside a batch of <a href="roasted-garlic-hummus">Cheesy Garlic Hummus</a>, which you should also check out
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 400F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Slice the peppers into large pieces, season with oil and salt, and bake for 30 minutes, or until the peppers are soft and charred<br><br>

- Drain and rinse the chickpeas, and add to a food processor. Blend with the peppers, lemon, almond butter (or tahini), and minced garlic until smooth<br><br>

- Add in your spices, and blend to combine. Adjust anything to taste, and store in the fridge
