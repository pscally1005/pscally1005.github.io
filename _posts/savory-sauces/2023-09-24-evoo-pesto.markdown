Description: If you're after more of a traditional <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#sauces">pesto</a> but still want to cut back on a bit of oil, then this pesto recipe is for you. Yes, extra virgin olive oil is a very healthy fat you should be consuming, but too much excess can lead to problems.  I typically prefer some type of pesto as the sauce on my <a href="pizza">Home Oven Baked Pizza</a>  This recipe cuts down on a bit of the oil while still preserving all the taste of the classic.  Each serving is about 45g, or 3 tbsp<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other pesto recipes, with varying amounts of oil, different kinds of nuts, vegan versions, and high protein versions:<br>- <a href="/recipes/oil-free-basil-pesto">Oil Free Basil Pesto</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/avocado-pesto">Avocado Pesto - Vegan and Oil Free</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto">Creamy Pesto Dip</a>
Instructions: 
- Add the almonds to a pan over medium heat. Toast the nuts for 2-3 minutes or until lightly fragrant and softened<br><br>

- Add the nuts and the rest of the ingredients to the food processor. Blend until smooth and combined. Thin out with more water if needed, and season with salt to taste
