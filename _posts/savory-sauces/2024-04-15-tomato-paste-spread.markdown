Description: This spread is a cross between a BBQ sauce and a burger special sauce, but made to be a thick, creamy, and spreadable, instead of running out of your sandwich.  I use this as a sauce on my <a href="burger-patties">Simple Burger Patties</a> and a dressing on my <a href="burger-bowl">Chopped Burger Bowl with Sweet Potatoes</a>, and it works fantastically for both.  Each of the 4 servings is about 60 g, or 3-4 tbsp
Instructions: 
- Mix all ingredients in a bowl or small food processor.  Mashed avocado is a good dairy free replacement for yogurt.  Spread on sandwiches, or use as a salad dressing.  Store leftovers in the fridge
