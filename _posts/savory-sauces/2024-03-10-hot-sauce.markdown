Description: I love Frank's hot sauce, I probably do actually put that shit on everything. Here's a simple 3 ingredient recreation of it. It's easy, spicy, and delicious.  I used this batch as the hot sauce on my homemade <a href="chicken-wings">Gluten Free Baked Buffalo Wings</a> the other day, and they were the best wings I've ever had!
Instructions: 
- Remove the stems (and seeds optionally, if you want to reduce the spice) from the peppers, and roughly chop into a large dice. They'll be blended later, so the size doesn't really matter<br><br>

- In a medium saucepot over high heat, combine the peppers, vinegar, and salt. Cover, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and let simmer for 10 minutes, or until the peppers are soft. Remove the cover, and let cool for 10 minutes<br><br>

- Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, then blend until smooth<br><br>

- Strain the hot sauce through a fine mesh strainer into a mason jar. Use a wooden spoon to grind out all of the liquid. Discard the pulp. Refrigerate for 2 weeks before using.<br><br>
