Description: This one is for all you garlic lovers out there. The garlic is roasty, pungent, and sweet. It's "cheesey" from the nutritional yeast, but you can use grated parmesan instead if you like<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other flavors of hummus as well!  They're all either contain either low or no oil, making them lower in fat and calories than traditional.  I have plenty of differnent flavors coming from various spices, roasted vegetables, differnet nut and seed butters, and even different beans:<br>- <a href="/recipes/classic-tahini-hummus">Classic Tahini Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-red-pepper-hummus">Roasted Red Pepper Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-hummus">Golden Sweet Potato Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/ginger-hummus">Ginger Lime Black Bean Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/hummus">Lemony Taco Inspired Hummus</a>

- Season with nutritional yeast and your spices, and blend to combine. Adjust anything to taste, and store in the fridge
