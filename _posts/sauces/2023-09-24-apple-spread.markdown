Description: Apple spread is my go to recipe in October, when I have too many apples from apple picking and I need to use up all 40 before they go bad. This apple butter has no added sugars, as the apples are more than sweet enough to flavor it. You can use this in place of unsweetened applesauce in any recipes for a significantly better result. Each serving is about 20g, or a big spoonful. For the ultimate peanut butter and jelly, make some homemade peanut butter and bread too<br><p><a href="ww-bread">100% Whole Wheat Bread</a></p><p><a href="natural-peanut-butter">Homemade Natural Nut Butter</a></p>
Instructions: 
- Cut each apple into 8ths and place in a crock pot.  An entire 3 lb bag, or about 9-10 gala apples, will be good for this recipe. Add cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and water<br><br>

- Cover and cook on low for 6 hours<br><br>

- Use an immersion blender to blend up the apples until everything is smooth<br><br>

- Loosely cover and cook on low for another 6 hours, stirring occasionally. Mix in lemon juice when done (to help preserve it)<br><br>

- Store in a mason jar<br><br>

- Alternatively, you can cook in a pot on the stovetop. Let the apple simmer over low heat (~2, uncovered) with occasional stirring for around 2 hours, or until the apples can be easily mashed. Then, blend with your immersion blender, and loosen up with a bit of water, depending on how thick you want it. Simmer the apple spread until it has reduced to your desired consistency, about another 2 hours over low. Squeeze in lemon juice
