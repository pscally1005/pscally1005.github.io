Description: Any time I made amaretti, macaroons, or anything that uses egg whites, I always struggle to find the use for my leftover yolks. This simple sauce is now my go to for not wasting perfectly good eggs, and uses Greek yogurt instead of butter for higher protein and lower saturated fat. For my cookie recipes, check out the links below<br><p><a href="coconut-macaroons">Coconut Macaroons with Honey</a></p><p><a href="amaretti">Amaretti Cookies with Monkfruit</a></p>
Instructions: 
- Assemble a double boiler by heating 1" of water in a medium pot. Place a glass bowl on top. Bring water to a simmer<br><br>

- Over the simmering water for about 15 minutes, whisk together eggs, lemon, yogurt and garlic. Stir frequently, until sauce has thickened and reached 160F<br><br>

- Stir in mustard and spices - basil, salt, sumin, paprika, black pepper, and red pepper flakes.  YOu can optionally also add a drop of liquid monk fruit or butter extract<br><br>

- Serve over roasted vegetables, use as a base for tuna salad, or however you want
