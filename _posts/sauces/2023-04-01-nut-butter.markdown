Description: Ah the humble peanut butter. Nice natural, smooth, pourable natural peanut butter. None of that fake no-stir peanut spread stuff, this is the real deal, and is possibly the easiest thing to ever make. As long as you have a good food processor, you'll end up with the best peanut butter you've ever had. Just keep blending until it's super smooth. It might take some time, so don't give up too early! PBJ is my personal kryptonite, so see what I use for jelly and bread below<br><p><a href="ww-bread">100% Whole Wheat Bread</a></p><p><a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a></p>
Instructions: 
- You can use whatever kind of nuts you like for this recipe.  Peanuts, almonds, pistachios, cashews, you name it.  For nut free alternatives, you can also use unsweetened shredded coconut flakes, sunflower seeds, or pumpkin seeds.  The concept is exactly the same<br><br>

- If the nuts are raw, pour them onto a cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Roast for 10 minutes at 350F. If the nuts are already roasted, ignore this step<br><br>

- Add just the nuts into a food processor, and process until smooth (on high). Stop every minute to scrape down the sides<br><br>

- Only when it is smooth, season with salt to taste.  You can also add any other flavorings, such as cinnamon, vanilla, or almond extract<br><br>

- Blend some more to mix it up, make sure it is very very smooth. It should be runny, almost as if it was melted. Store in a mason jar at room temperature
