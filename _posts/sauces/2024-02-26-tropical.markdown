Description: This sweet and sour tropical fruit salsa is perfect for fajitas. I personally don't bother with buying a whole pineapple and instead get the precut, but ripe fresh mangos are really a must here. For my fajita recipe, check out the link below<br><p><a href="fajitas">Chicken Fajitas with Peppers</a></p>
Instructions: 
- Chop the onion, mango, and pineapple into very small pieces<br><br>

- Mix the fruit with the ingredients above - dressing, hot sauce, lime, thyme, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cilantro
