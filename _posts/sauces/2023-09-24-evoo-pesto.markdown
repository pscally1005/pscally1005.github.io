Description: If you're after more of a traditional pesto but still want to cut back on a bit of oil, then this pesto recipe is for you. Yes, extra virgin olive oil is a very healthy fat you should be consuming, but too much excess can lead to problems. This recipe cuts down on a bit of the oil while still preserving all the taste of the classic. Each serving is about 45g, or 3 tbsp
Instructions: 
- Add the almonds to a pan over medium heat. Toast the nuts for 2-3 minutes or until lightly fragrant and softened<br><br>

- Add the nuts and the rest of the ingredients to the food processor. Blend until smooth and combined. Thin out with more water if needed, and season with salt to taste
