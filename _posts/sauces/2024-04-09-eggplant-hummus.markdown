Description: This is 50% hummus, 50% babaganoush, and 100% delicious. Roasted eggplant in hummus provides great creaminess and fantastic flavor without the need for oil. The subtle flavor of almond butter adds some necessary fats, and complements everything else perfectly.

Instructions: 
- Cut your eggplant in half, and add to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Bake cut side down at 400F for about 40 minutes, or until eggplant is soft and collapses.<br><br>
