Description: I'll make this quick protein packed chocolate spread every so often, and store the leftovers in the fridge. It's sweet without being loaded with added sugars, and goes great on toast or on oatmeal. Each serving is about 2 tbsp or 40g
Instructions: 
- Mix all ingredients in a small container, and store the leftovers in the fridge<br><br>

- Optionally, you can turn this spread into some chocolate protein bites. Mix in unflavored casein (1 scoop, 30 g) and oat flour (2 tbsp, 15 g), and shape into balls. Makes about 10-12<br><br>
