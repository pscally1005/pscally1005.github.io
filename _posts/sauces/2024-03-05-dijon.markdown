Description: Dijon mustard is one of my favorite condiments, from on sandwiches to salads. I wanted to try making it myself, especially since some brands and other recipes have added sugar. You can also add some spices into it as well if you like.  The typical serving for mustard is 1 tsp or 5 g.
Instructions: 
- In a medium glass or plastic (not metal) bowl, soak the mustard seeds in 3/4 cup (180 g) of white vinegar. Cover, and refrigerate for 12-24 hours<br><br>

- Use a fine mesh strainer to drain the mustard seeds, discarding the soaking liquid<br><br>

- Combine the now hydrated mustard seeds with the rest of the vinegar (1/4 cup, 60 g), cooking wine, and salt in a blended or food processor<br><br>

- Blend on low speed for 20 seconds, then on high speed for 15 seconds. Scrape down the sides, and repeat. Blend another 20-30 seconds if you want a smoother texture<br><br>

- Transfer to a mason jar, and refrigerate for at least 24 hours before using, as this will make it less better. It should keep in the fridge for a few months
