Description: Spinach Artichoke dip is a game day classic, but also a calorie bomb. I lightened it up here by avoiding all the extra cream and using minimal cheese, but still while preserving that great taste. This goes great with some carrots, crackers, or on a sandwich or salad.
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 400F, and spray a 9x13" baking dish with oil<br><br>

- In a large mixing bowl, combine together your yogurt and cottage cheese. If your cottage cheese wasn't previously blended (I typically blend my whole container when I buy it), you can use an electric mixer or an immersion blender here<br><br>

- Take your defrosted spinach and squeeze it dry with paper towels, and add to the bowl. Drain and rinse your artichokes with a strainer, cut them into a small dice, and add to the bowl<br><br>

- Mix in the rest of the ingredients (besides the parmesean) - shredded cheese, minced garlic, hot sauce, mustard, garlic and onion powder, pepper, and salt<br><br>

- Bake (uncovered) for 25 minutes at 400F. Broil the top for 5 minutes after to brown the cheese (if your broiler works unlike mine lol), and serve warm
