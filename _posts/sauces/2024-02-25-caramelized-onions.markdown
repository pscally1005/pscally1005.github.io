Description: Caramelized onions are simple and delicious, but take a while with often stirring on the stove. I've done them in a slow cooker here, so you can let them go all day, and check on them every hour or so. Caramelized Onions are great on nearly everything, give it a go
Instructions: 
- Slice all your onions, and add to a large slow cooker. Season, and mix, making sure to separate the onions from other layers<br><br>

- Cover and cook on high for 8-10 hours, stirring occasionally. Deglaze with some white wine if needed.  Store in a container in the fridge
