Description: Here's a very simple homemade pasta sauce, starting from a humble can of crushed tomatoes. This yields enough sauce to flavor a pound of pasta, maybe with some added meat and vegetables. It couldn't be easier, just saute an onion, and dump in the tomatoes and any desired spices. From there, just simmer as long as you like. I also use this to top pizzas as well!
Instructions: 
- Cook onions, garlic, and oil on medium until the onion is soft and translucent<br><br>

- While the onion is cooking, add in your spices - oregano, basil, parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, and red pepper flakes<br><br>

- When onion is softened, add in the can of crushed tomatoes<br>

- Set timer for 2 hours, cover, set to low, and stir every 15 minutes
