Description: As someone who is loves cottage cheese and is addicted to peanut butter, this spread should help curb all my peanut butter cravings. It's blended together PB2, cottage cheese, and banana, for a delicious peanut flavored spread for my morning yogurt. For the same 32g serving, there is only 1/4 of the calories, and over twice the amount of protein per 100 g
Instructions: 
- Blend together cottage cheese, PB2, overripe banana, cinnamon, and almond extract in a small food processor.  Transfer to an airtight container, and store in the fridge.  Optionally garnish with peanuts and chickpeas as I did here<br><br>

- Chickpeas can be used instead of cottage cheese, but you will want to add about 1/2 cup (120 g) of unsweetened vanilla almond milk and 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) salt
