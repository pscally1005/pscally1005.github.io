Description: This is less of a recipe and more of a method, as you'd probably use sweet potato puree in something else. Try replacing bananas, applesauce, or pumpkin puree in my baked goods with this for an even more delicious flavor. I personally like making my <a href="oats-pumpkin">Pumpkin Pie Protein Overnight Oats</a> or <a href="fudge">Coconut Chocolate Fudge Squares</a> using sweeet potato puree instead.  You could also use this as baby food, or turn them into mashed potatoes. This yields about 300g puree, depending on the size of your potatoes.  Similar is my <a href="roasted-butternut-squash-puree">Roasted Butternut Squash Puree</a>, which can also be used just like sweet potato puree!  For double sweet potato action, use this puree as a spread on <a href="sweet-potato-bread">Whole Wheat Sweet Potato Loaf</a>
Instructions: 
- Wash the potatoes. Prick with a fork on all over about 10 times, and wrap in aluminum foil<br><br>

- Bake in the oven for 90 minutes at 400F until very soft. You can also use the air fryer at 400F for 1 hour. Set aside to cool before peeling<br><br>

- Puree with an immersion blender or food processor, or use a potato masher. Store in the fridge<br><br>

- You can also turn this into mashed potatoes (keep the skins on). Season to taste with garlic and onion powder, pepper, salt, paprika, and parsley<br><br>
