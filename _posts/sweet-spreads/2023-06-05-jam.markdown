Description: As you probably know by now, I love a good PBJ with a low sugar jam. This simple berry jam makes use of extra fresh blackberries or raspberries that you probably picked up at a farmers market. The pectin in the apples helps thicken it and make it slightly sweeter, and the little maple syrup really rounds out the flavors. Each serving is about 1 tbsp, or 19g.
Instructions: 
- To a 10‚Äù pan, add the berries and maple syrup. Mash with a potato masher<br><br>

- Over medium heat, add in applesauce, and bring to light simmer. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes<br><br>

- In a small bowl, mix together oat flour and water to create a slurry, and slowly add to the jam while stirring to avoid clumps. Cook for another 2-3 minutes<br><br>

- Squeeze in some lemon juice at the end to help preserve it<br><br>

- Remove from heat, transfer to a container, and let cool at room temperature for half an hour before moving to the fridge
