Description: As someone who is loves hummus and is addicted to peanut butter, this spread should help curb all my peanut butter cravings. It's blended together PB2, chickpeas, and banana, for a delicious peanut flavored spread for my morning yogurt. For the same 32g serving, there is only 1/4 of the calories
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas, and add to a large food processor. Add in the rest of the ingredients, and blend until smooth. Adjust consistency with more or less milk
