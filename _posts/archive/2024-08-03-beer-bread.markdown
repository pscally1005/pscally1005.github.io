Description: Beer bread takes me back to my childhood, as my dad would occasionally make it. I had some Blue Moon lying around after a friend left it over, so I decided to turn a bottle into some whole wheat beer bread for a small gathering. It's a super quick and easy bread that goes well on its own, or with any spread on top, like butter, jam, or peanut butter
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 375F, and lightly grease a loaf pan with olive oil<br><br>

- In a mixing bowl add the dry ingredients and whisk until well combined - flour, baking powder, and salt<br><br>

- Add in the honey (or maple syrup) and beer (I used Blue Moon). Mix until it forms a well combined dough<br><br>

- Transfer your dough into a loaf pan and spread evenly to all sides. Cross the top with a knife, and optionally sprinkle the top with flour (or oat flour)<br><br>

- Bake for about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean and the internal temperature is at least 190F.  The edges and top should be golden brown<br><br>

- Allow to cool totally in the pan before removing and slicing.  This bread is best served warm, so toast, bake, or air fry for a few minutes at 400F, until done to your liking.  Store any leftover bread in the fridge or freezer<br><br>
