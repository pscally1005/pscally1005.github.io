Description: Here is a giant chocolate chip cookie. Because that's what cookie cake is. I've made it sugar and gluten free, utilizing sugar free syrup and coconut flour. Maple syrup or honey would also work as sweeteners, but I wouldn't recommend replacing the coconut flour. This dessert is like eating a large chocolate chip cookie with a fork. It would probably be considered keto too if you're into that, and would go great with a scoop of <a href="neopolitan-banana-ice-cream">Neopolitan Banana Ice Cream</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and liberally spray an 8" circular cake pan with oil. You don't want it to stick!<br><br>

- Starting with the chocolate chips - in a small bowl, melt the coconut oil, and combine with the cocoa powder and sweetener<br><br>

- Transfer to a parchment lined container, and freeze for at least 15 minutes to harden<br><br>

- Moving on to the cake - in a medium bowl, whisk together the liquid sweetener, melted coconut oil, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, and salt (all ingredients except the coconut oil and chocolate)<br><br>

- Add in the coconut flour, and use a silicone spatula to mix together. The cookie dough should seem way too liquidly at first, but the coconut flour will absorb a lot of moisture, leaving you with a mildly sticky cookie dough<br><br>

- Transfer the cookie dough to the pan, and press to an even thickness to all sides<br><br>

- Roughly chop your chocolate into small pieces, and press on top of the cake<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 15 minutes, or until lightly golden on the edges, and a toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cake to totally cool before slicing and serving<br><br>
