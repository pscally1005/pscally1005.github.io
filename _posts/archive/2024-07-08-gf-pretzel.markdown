Description: These pretzels are a spin off my <a href="coconut-bread">Gluten and Grain Free Coconut Bread</a> made into pretzels using a pan I found online. They're a great alternative to standard hot pretzels for anyone with Celiac Disease, and they have a great cheesy garlic flavor.
Instructions: 
- The goal of this recipe was to make an easy gluten free pretzel that didn't require kneading, shaping, or boiling.  The result is the best middle ground I can come up with for ease to make as well as taste and texture.  Below is a photo of the pan I used.  I had to do some digging online to find this, so just look around<br><br>

- In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients - coconut flour, whey, baking powder, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder<br><br>

- Add the wet ingredients on top, and mix together with a silicone spatula until fully combined - eggs, apple cider vinegar, applesauce, and shredded cheese<br><br>

- Liberally grease a pretzel pan with oil, and spoon the batter into the pan. Smooth out the tops with a spoon. Lightly spray the tops with oil, and sprinkle the tops with everything bagel seasoning<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 18 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean, the internal temperature is around 205F, and they are golden brown on the edges<br><br>

- These pretzels are best enjoyed warm. To reheat, air fry at 400F for about 2 minutes, or until warm and crispy. Serve on its own, or with your favorite dipping sauce (mustard, cheese, peanut butter, whatever you want!)
