Description: This is part 1 of me trying to make a classic chocolate chip cookie in a much healthier way.  First up is chickpeas, which provide a great neutral base for the cookies, allowing them to stay moist without all the fat of butter, and while being packed with fiber.  For some healthy fats and some sweetness, I've used natural peanut butter and sugar free syrup.  These cookies are gluten and grain free, using coconut flour instead, and use a homemade sugar free chocolate using just 3 ingredients.  They don't taste like beans at all, and can even be enjoyed raw!<br>&emsp;For part 2, see my <a href="cottage-cheese-cookies">Cottage Cheese Cookies</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Also line a small Tupperware with parchment.<br><br>

- Start with the chocolate chips, since these will need to fully solidify in the fridge.  In a small bowl, add the coconut oil, and melt in the microwave for 1:30<br><br>

- Add the cocoa powder, syrup, and a few grains of salt to the coconut oil, and mix until smooth<br><br>

- Pour the chocolate into a parchment lined Tupperware, and refrigerate until solid, about 30 minutes<br><br>

- Meanwhile, move into the cookie dough.  To a food processor, add your (drained and rinsed) chickpeas, syrup, and vanilla.  Maple syrup or honey can be used in place of sugar free syrup.  Blend until smooth, and transfer to a large bowl<br><br>

- Mix the rest of the cookie dough ingredients (nut butter, salt, baking powder, and coconut flour) with a silicone spatula until fully combined.  I've used natural peanut butter, but almond butter, pistachio butter, sunflower seed butter, or pumpkin seed butter would also work.  Oat or almond flour would probably work instead of coconut, but start with at least double by weight, and go on feel.  The dough should be slightly sticky<br><br>

- Let chill in the fridge for 15 minutes to cool down. The mix may warm up as it blends, so chilling it prevents the chocolate from melting<br><br>

- Chop your chocolate into small chunks, and fold into the batter<br><br>

- Scoop the batter onto your pan, and press down each cookie until it is flat and round.  The cookies will rise slightly in the oven, but they will not spread outward.  Lightly wet your hands to prevent sticking when shaping the cookies<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 13-15 minutes, or until the cookies have risen slightly, and the bottoms are a light golden brown.  Be careful to not overcook them<br><br>

- Let cool on the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.  Store in an airtight container in the fridge<br><br>

- You can also enjoy these as edible cookie dough bites, just omit the baking powder<br><br>
