Description: These cookies are perfect to use with cookie cutters to cut into your own shapes. This are great for holidays, and you can tailor them to whatever the day is. This batch was for July 4, wheat each cookie is a star, with the 2 letter code of each state drawn on. I'm definitely not an artist, so hopefully you can do a better job than me
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, beat the egg, and mix with the rest of the wet ingredients (maple syrup, peanut butter, and applesauce). Add in the dry ingredients (oat flour, cornstarch, cocoa, baking soda, and salt), and fold together with a spatula, or your hands if needed. The dough will feel a little drier and denser, since it needs to be able to be rolled out. Chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes<br><br>

- Roll out the dough between 2 pieces of parchment paper to about 1/4" thick. Use cookie cutters to cut out the cookies, and place on a parchment lined baking sheet<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 12 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely before frosting<br><br>

- In a small bowl, prepare your peanut butter cream frosting - whipped cottage cheese, peanut butter, PB2, and maple syrup.  You can also add 1/2 tbsp (8 g) melted coconut oil, if you want your filling to harden a bit more<br><br>

- Spread a little bit of icing on each cookie, being conservative as to not run out of icing. This cookie cutter was very small, which is why there are so many servings according to the recipe
