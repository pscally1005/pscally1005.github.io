Description: It has come to my attention that some heathens prefer the processed no stir peanut butters to the silky smooth nectar of the gods that is natural peanut butter. I kid of course, but if that's you, then you may like this recipe. Instead of just peanuts and salt, typically no stir peanut butter has added sugar (because of course) and hydrogenated oils (solid fat to change the texture). My version here uses granular sweetener and coconut oil to achieve the same thing in a healthier way. Each serving is 2 tbsp, or 32 g
Instructions: 
- In a food processor, blend your nuts until super smooth, scraping down the sides every minute or so. Season with salt, and blend to fully combine it in. Your natural peanut butter is done!<br><br>

- To ruin it (again, kidding), add in your sweetener and melted coconut oil. Blend to fully combine, and transfer to a mason jar. Store at room temperature (or in the fridge if you like it firmer and want it to last a little longer)
