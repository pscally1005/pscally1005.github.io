Description: Similar to the <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a>, this is more of a method than a recipe, as unless you're a baby I don't expect you'll be eating this on its own. Butternut squash is a great pumpkin replacement, especially in this <a href="oats-pumpkin">Pumpkin Pie Protein Overnight Oats</a>, or my <a href="pumpkin-bread">Protein Pumpkin Loaf</a>.  Butternut squash puree can also be used in place of mashed banana or applesauce; I've even had great success using it in my <a href="chickpea-brownies">Chickpea Protein Brownies</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 400F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper<br><br>

- Slice off the stem of the squash and cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds using a spoon. Sprinkle the inside with a little bit of salt<br><br>

- Place the cut side down on the cookie sheet. Prick the skin of the squash with a fork<br><br>

- Roast for about 50-70 minutes, or until tender. A knife should be able to easily pierce through it without any force<br><br>

- Flip over and let cool until you can safely handle it, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Scrape off the insides from the skin and place into a large bowl. Mash with a potato masher, or blend in a food processor.
