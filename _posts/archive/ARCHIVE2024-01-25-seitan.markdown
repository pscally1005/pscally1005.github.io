Description: I'm not vegan, I'm just trying to get through my 4 lb bag of Vital Wheat Gluten without baking enough bread to feed an entire village. This meatless protein option is a great way to mix it up, and can be used in any way you would typically use ground meat. Mix it into a rice and vegetable bowl, serve a sauce over it with vegetables, make tacos, the possibilities are endless.
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, combine together dry ingredients - vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast (or grated cheese), chili powder, paprika, onion powder, black pepper, and salt<br><br>

- In a mason jar, add the broth and soy sauce, cover, and shake. In place of 3/4 cup vegetable broth, you can use 3/4 cup water + 3/4 tsp bouillon powder.  Pour into the dry bowl, and mix to form a dough<br><br>

- Knead in the bowl for a few minutes, or until the dough becomes elastic. Shape into a large ball<br><br>

- In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Here, I used broth, and it was too salty. Don't make the same mistake, cook it in water<br><br>

- Break the dough into smaller "meat" balls, so that way they're submerged in the pot. Reduce to medium heat, cover, and cook for about 45 minutes, mashing occasionally with a wooden spoon. Most of the water will have cooked off<br><br>

- When done cooking, remove from the pot and let it cool. You should now have a ground meat substitute that can be used in place of meat in most recipes<br><br>
