Description: These delicious and fudgy brownies are made with just 2 simple ingredients - melted chocolate and eggs.  I've put "Two" in quotes, as you can instead make a homemade chocolate, or add some optional flavorings or mix ins.  They can be sugar free depending on your chocolate as well.<br>&emsp;I'm no artist, but I made these to celebrate Vic's half marathon, so I drizzled a 13.1 in a peanut butter glaze.  The glaze is just 2 parts peanut butter to 1 part honey and 1 part melted coconut oil.<br>&emsp;The nutrition facts are assuming you use just the homemade chocolate instead of the chocolate chips; no mix ins or additional flavorings
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line an 8" square pan with parchment paper. Spray the paper with oil<br><br>

- Microwave your chocolate in 20-30 second intervals, stirring in between, until fully melted<br><br>

- If you choose to make your own chocolate instead, microwave the coconut oil for about 1:30 until fully melted. Stir in the cocoa and sweetener until smooth<br><br>

- Either way, set your chocolate aside to cool after melting<br><br>

- Meanwhile, crack your eggs into a large bowl. Beat with a hand mixer until frothy, about 1-2 minutes<br><br>

- Transfer the melted chocolate into the eggs, and beat until smooth, about 1 minute. Optionally, add in any other ingredients, like salt, extracts, chocolate chips, or nuts. Transfer the batter to your pan, and spread to all corners<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 16-20 minutes, or until a toothpick to the center comes out moist with a few crumbs, but not too dirty.  If it's clean, the brownies are overcooked<br><br>

- Let cool on the counter for a few minutes before transferring to the fridge to cool and set (at least a few hours) before cutting and serving
