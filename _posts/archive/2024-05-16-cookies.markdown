Description: Here's a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe. I usually only make and post healthy recipes, but it's okay to enjoy the classic treat from time to time. Chocolate chip cookies are usually what I make to bring for an occasion; that way I can have 1 or 2 every so often, and I can leave someone else with the rest.  I made these to celebrate Vic getting into UF for her Master's Degree
Instructions: 
- Mix together sugar, honey, and (melted) butter with a hand mixer until fluffy. Beat in egg and mix in vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Fully combine, then mix in the flour. Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Chill the dough in the fridge (at least 30 minutes) if using melted butter. Not necessary if butter is softened<br><br>

- Bake for 8-9 min at 350F on a parchment lined cookie sheet. Transfer to a wire rack to cool
