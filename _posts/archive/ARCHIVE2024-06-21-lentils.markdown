Description: Red lentils are a fantastic addition to your diet. They're a great side carb source that is also high in protein and fiber. Red split lentils are just as easy to cook as rice, take a fraction of the time, and are healthier. And they're not that much more expensive too. I got a 1 lb bag for $1.50, and normally brown rice runs me $1 per lb.
Instructions: 
- Using a fine mesh strainer, rinse the lentils under cold water, removing any pebbles or discolored pieces. Transfer to a small pot with water and bouillon powder<br><br>

- Cover and bring to a boil. Keep covered, reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer, and cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally
