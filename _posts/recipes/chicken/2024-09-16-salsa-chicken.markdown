Description: Would you believe that this 2 ingredient salsa chicken contains just salsa and chicken? Wild concept, I know, I bet you're beyond shocked. This is probably the most low effort protein source you can make, and still tastes great. With just a pack of chicken thighs and a jar of salsa, you can have a easy meat ready for you at the end of the day.  I've gone with storebought salsa here, but you can also use a full batch of my <a href="/recipes/salsa">Five Minute Salsa (No Garlic/Onion)</a> as well!
