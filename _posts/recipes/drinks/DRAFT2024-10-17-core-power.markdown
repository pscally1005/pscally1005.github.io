For <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Core-Power-Protein-Shake-with-26g-Protein-by-fairlife-Milk-Vanilla-14-fl-oz/822766999?classType=VARIANT&athbdg=L1103&from=/search">26 g of protein</a> and fairly minimal ingredients (besides some artificial sweeteners), these seemed pretty good to have on occasion.

Instructions: 
- Add the protein powders, vanilla extract, and sweetener to a shaker bottle. Add just the water, and vigorously shake until all the protein is dissolved. Pour in the milk, shake until fully combined, and enjoy
