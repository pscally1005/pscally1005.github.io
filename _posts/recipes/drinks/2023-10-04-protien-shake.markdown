Description: I used to never be a fan of protein shakes, but upon switching to unflavored protein powder I was able to customize them a lot more and avoid the gross sucralose taste, in my opinion. I'll normally have this to add some extra protein at a meal if I'm missing a protein source, like a meatless salad.
Instructions: 
- Add all ingredients to a shaker bottle and shake.  Sometimes I like to add in a serving of electrolyte powder as well
