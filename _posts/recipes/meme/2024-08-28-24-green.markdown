Description: Would you believe me if I told you this bread was made with no food dye? Of course you wouldn't, because this looks too ridiculous to be natural. But it is. As I accidentally found out while making <a href="/recipes/banana-bread">Oatmeal Banana Mini Muffins</a> with sunflower butter in place of peanut butter, the chlorophyll in the sunflower seeds reacts with the baking soda, turning the baked good green.<br>&emsp;I've taken that to the extreme here with this Green Bread, which is free of artificial dyes, added sugar, added oils, gluten, nuts, and grains.  It's mildly sweet from the bananas and some (optional) honey, but you can use avocado (in place of banana) for some extra green points. This bread makes a great high fat low carb breakfast, and goes well topped with some <a href="/recipes/strawberry-chia-jam">Strawberry Chia Jam</a> for some color contrast
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a 9x5" loaf pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a food processor, blend together your sunflower seeds on high until a smooth butter forms, about 5-10 minutes. You could also use 1 cup (256 g) of sunflower butter instead<br><br>

- Only once your super smooth seed butter has formed, add in the rest of the ingredients.  Blend until smooth, and transfer your batter to the pan.  Optionally, add some honey (note that the nutrition facts do not include the honey)<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 40 minutes. A toothpick should come out clean, and the bread should have an internal temperature around 205F<br><br>

- Let cool for at least 1 hour before slicing.  Don't worry if the inside looks more tan than green; the color will turn more the next day.  Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer
