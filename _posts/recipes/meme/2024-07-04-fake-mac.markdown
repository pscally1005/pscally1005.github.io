Description: This is a healthier mac and cheese recipe that's free of both the mac and the cheese (no it's not an empty plate). Instead of traditional pasta, I've roasted a spaghetti squash, but zucchini noodles will also work. The star of the show is a dairy free cheese <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#sauces">sauce</a> made of cashews. It's creamy and delicious without all the lactose, and tastes like real cheese (I know because I still eat cheese lol). This is a great LCHF meal if you're looking to boost your healthy fat intake without increasing your caloric intake.<br>&emsp;The sauce recipe is a modified version of "Vegan Carrot Noodle Mac and Cheese" in the cook book Genius Kitchen with inspiration taken from other vegan nut based cheese sauces.  For another vegan cheese sauce dish, see my <a href="/recipes/cheesy-cauliflower-rice-and-beans">Cheesy Cauliflower Rice & Beans</a>
Instructions: 
- Add the nuts to a large bowl and cover with water. For a nut free version, use sunflower seeds. Cover with a cloth, and let soak in the fridge for 8 hours. Discard the soaking liquid<br><br>

- I'm going to cook my spaghetti squash in the oven, but feel free to look at <a href="/recipes/spaghetti-squash">Spaghetti Squash Cooked 3 Ways</a> for some other options. To start prick it with a knife and microwave it for 5 minutes to make it easier to slice. Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 400F<br><br>

- Cut the squash in half lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds with a spoon<br><br>

- Add your spices (salt, garlic, and onion powder) to a small bowl, and mix. Lightly oil the squash, and sprinkle on your seasonings<br><br>

- Roast (cut side down) for about 45 minutes at 400F on a parchment lined cookie sheet. The squash should be tender and easily come off the skin without a fork, without being mushy and overcooked<br><br>

- Meanwhile, as the squash cooks, you can prepare the cheese sauce. To a food processor, add your nuts, water, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth<br><br>

- Add in the nutritional yeast, mustard, minced garlic, and spices (paprika, salt, and pepper). Again, blend until smooth<br><br>

- When the squash is done cooking, fluff it with a fork, and add to a lightly greased 9x13" pan. Pour over the cheese sauce, and mix well<br><br>

- Roast uncovered for about 10-15 minutes, or until bubbly and lightly charred. You can optionally add some breadcrumbs and broil the top. Top with parsley, and serve<br><br>

- I've also done the exact same concept with my <a href="/recipes/avocado-pesto">Avocado Pesto - Vegan and Oil Free</a>, which was just as delicious and simple.  Go check it out!<br><br>
