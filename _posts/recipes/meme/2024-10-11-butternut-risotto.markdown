Description: This butternut squash risOATto doesn't use arborio rice.  Instead, I'm using rolled oats as my base.  <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Rolled_oats_by_MILLVILLE_943490_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">Oats</a> get just as creamy for a perfect risotto, while also being a whole grain and containing 5x the fiber and 2x the protein of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Arborio_rice_by_BELARIA_518910_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">white arborio rice</a>.  Plus, I always have oats on hand; I don't need to buy a specific type of rice just for 1 dish.  The butternut squash provides some mild sweetness while also making the risotto creamy without the need for butter.  The combination of toasting the oats and the grated cheese gives this dish a classic but elevated feel that you're sure to love.  It's vegetarian and gluten free, and can be made vegan by swapping the grated cheese for nutritional yeast and chicken bouillon for veggie bouillon.
Instructions: 
- Peel and dice the squash, and add to a large bowl.  Season with olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt<br><br>

- Wait about half an hour before starting the risOATto, since you want the oats to be done around the same time as the squash is done roasting<br><br>

- Heat EVOO in a Dutch oven over medium heat.  Add oats and bouillon powder, and toast the oats until fragrant, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Add in the water and simmer uncovered with occasional stirring until creamy (about 10 minutes)<br><br>
