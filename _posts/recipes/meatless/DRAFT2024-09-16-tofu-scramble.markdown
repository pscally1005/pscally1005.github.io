Description: Tofu is both a good meat replacement and egg replacement for vegans and vegetarians, being a good cheap source of protein. This tofu scramble can be used in any way you would eggs, like on toast or mixed with vegetables. Or you can use ground tofu and a ground meat replacement; I've made <a href="/recipes/chili">Slow Cooker Chili</a> using ground tofu before to great success
