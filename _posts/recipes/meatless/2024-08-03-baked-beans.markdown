Description: Do you like <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#baked-beans">baked beans</a>? Of course you do. Unfortunately, most canned and homemade recipes contain tons and tons of sugar, containing as much as some desserts. This recipe is sugar free, and no that doesn't mean there's a ton of maple syrup, honey, or molasses instead. Gochujang does have a little bit of added sugar, but other than that this recipe is totally unsweetened, relying on just the sweetness of the onions and tomatoes for a delicious savory side dish that pairs great with some <a href="/recipes/cornbread">Cheesy Protein Cornbread</a>  
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and heat a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat with olive oil<br><br>

- Cut your onion into a fine dice, and add to the pot. Cover, and cook for about 5 minutes, or until translucent and lightly browned<br><br>

- Add minced garlic, gochujang (or chili paste) and water. Cover and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes<br><br>

- Drain and rinse your beans.  Traditionally, baked beans are made with navy beans, but any other kind of bean (pinto, kidney, black, etc. will work as well).  Add the beans to the pot, along with the remaining ingredients. Cover and let simmer for 5 minutes<br><br>

- If you're using a Dutch oven, you can bake directly in there.  If not, transfer your beans to an 8" square baking dish.  Bake in a 350F oven (covered) for 45 minutes.  You can also cook in a slow cooker on low for about 4-6 hours
