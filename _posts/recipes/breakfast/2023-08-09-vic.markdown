Description: An overnight oats recipe I developed for my girlfriend, which I made a little sweeter than my standard overnight oats, but still with a good dose of fiber, protein, and healthy fats to start your morning off right.  For a variation without protein powder, check out my <a href="no-protein-powder-oatmeal">Overnight Oats with no Protein Powder</a>
Instructions: 
- Add ingredients to a tupperware or bowl, and mix until fully combined. Optionally top with mini chocolate chips. Store in the fridge overnight<br><br>

- Some ingredient swaps include:<br>- Using honey (1/2 tbsp, 10 g) instead of jelly (1 tbsp, 18 g)<br>- A mashed overripe banana (1 banana, ~110 g) instead of unsweetened applesauce (6 tbsp, 90 g).  Mash the banana first, before adding other ingredients<br>- Whey protein instead of casein (same amount by weight and volume, but it'll be less thick)<br>- Or more protein powder if you're out of chia seeds<br>- Optionally, you can also add 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) liquid monk fruit if you want it slightly sweeter
