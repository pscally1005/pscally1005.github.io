Description: It's officially October, which means it's apple picking and pumpkin spice season.  This recipe is essentially a <a href="/recipes/banana-bread">banana bread</a>, but using <a href="/recipes/apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> in place of mashed bananas.  It's a perfect fall breakfast or dessert that's full of cinnamon flavor without any added sugar or butter.  It's also gluten free and nut free as well!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a 9x5" bread pan with parchment paper.  Lightly spray the paper with oil<br><br>

- In a large bowl, combine together the wet ingredients - <a href="/recipes/apple-spread">apple spread</a>, tahini (or any other <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">nut or seed butter</a>), and eggs<br><br>
