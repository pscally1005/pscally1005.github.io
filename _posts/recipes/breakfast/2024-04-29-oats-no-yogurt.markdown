Description: Most of my protein overnight oats recipes use plain nonfat Greek yogurt. But if you can't digest it, or you don't have any on hand, you can use this as a base instead. I've basically just doubled the protein powder and added a little sweetener to compensate.  Here, I've used sugar free syrup, but honey or maple syrup are also good sweeteners.  I've also gone with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CK355821/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">stevia sweetened electrolyte powder</a> that I've used in <a href="/recipes/electrolyte-protein-shake">Electrolyte Protein Shake</a>, giving me a vitamin and electrolyte boost while also acting as my sweetener.  <br>&emsp;Oats are such a blank slate - replace the banana with pumpkin, add some cocoa powder, swirl in some peanut butter or PB2, top with fruit; the possibilities are endless, create your perfect bowl!

Instructions: 
- Mash the banana in a bowl, and mix with the rest of the ingredients. Either refrigerate overnight to enjoy cold, or microwave on high for 2 minutes (stirring halfway) to enjoy warm
