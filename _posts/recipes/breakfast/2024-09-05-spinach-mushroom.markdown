Description: Did you know that you can meal prep eggs? Yup, breakfast meal prep isn't reserved for just overnights oats or yogurt. This batch of food makes 4 servings, and is a good source of protein and vegetables in the morning
Instructions: 
- Preheat a 12" nonstick pan over medium heat with olive oil<br><br>

- Wash your mushrooms, and add to a food processor. Pulse, mix, and repeat until the mushrooms are finely chopped. Don't forget to stop and mix, or they'll be over-blended and watery. I like to use my food processor to finely chop my mushrooms as I don't like the texture of larger pieces, but you can use a knife and cutting board for larger chunks if you desire<br><br>

- Add mushrooms and spinach to your pan with all your spices - chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, pepper, and salt. Mix, cover, and cook over medium heat until the water has cooked out, about 10 minutes<br><br>

- Lower the burner to medium low, and take the pan off the heat. Add your eggs and egg whites, and combine together with a wooden spoon<br><br>

- Return the pan to the heat, and cook over medium low with frequent stirring until just fully cooked. Remove from heat, and mix in lemon juice and minced garlic<br><br>

- Divide your eggs into 4 containers, and top with each with 1/4 of your feta<br><br>

- To reheat, cover with a damp paper towel, and microwave on high for 2-3 minutes
