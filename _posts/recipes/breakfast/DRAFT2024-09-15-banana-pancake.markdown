Description: Unlike regular <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#pancakes">pancakes</a>, these will serve to keep you fully all the way until lunch. With protein of the whey and fiber of the oats, plus the addition of mashed banana, this serves as a perfect fall recipe. These also work as waffles as well, but I prefer the pancakes.  For a very similar pancake recipe with pumpkin instead, check out my <a href="/recipes/pancake">Pumpkin Protein Pancakes</a>.  Or, for more banana recipes, see my <a href="banana-protein">Protein Banana Nut Bread</a>, <a href="double-chocolate-banana-bread">Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a>, or <a href="oats-banana">Banana Nut Bread Protein Overnight Oats</a>
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, mash a banana with the back of a fork.  Combine in the rest of the ingredients.  Let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes<br><br>

- Meanwhile, preheat a large nonstick pan over medium heat with a spray of oil. The pan should sound like it's sizzling lightly when the batter is spooned in<br><br>

- Scoop batter into the pan. Cover, and cook over medium heat for about a minute, or until bubbles start to form. Flip, and cook for an additional minute. Remove from the pan, transfer to a wire rack or plate, and repeat. This recipe should make about 6 small pancakes and serves 1 person<br><br>

- These also work as waffles. Cook on medium heat or so for 2-3 minutes
