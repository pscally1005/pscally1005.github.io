Description: Shakshuka is an egg, tomato, and veggie based dish that originates in Northern Africa. It's a delicious breakfast that's packed with protein and vegetables that will leave you satisfied until lunch. Or it can be served as any meal of the day. You can also serve it on top of some toast
Instructions: 
- Cut your pepper and onion each into a small dice. Add to a 10" stainless steel pan over medium heat with a spray of oil and salt. Cover, and cook until the peppers and soft and onions are translucent, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Add in the minced garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds<br><br>

- Pour in the diced tomatoes and add the spices - paprika, chili, garlic, onion, cumin, and pepper. Cover and let simmer for 5 minutes over medium heat<br><br>

- Make 3 wells, and crack each egg into its own well. Cover, and cook for 2-3 minutes over medium heat until the whites are cooked (opaque white) and the yolks have risen and are cloudy, but still a bit soft<br><br>

- Garnish with parsley, and optionally serve with bread. Eat directly out of the pan (that's why I used stainless steel)
