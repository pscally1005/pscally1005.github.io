Description: I love myself a classic natural nut butter, but sometimes I like to mix it up with various different flavors. It's sweet but sugar free, healthy, and lower in fat, since some of the nuts are replaced with fruit or other ingredients. I've also added a scoop of protein powder to add some more protein, since there is proportionally less nuts than regular nut butter.
Instructions: 
- In a food processor, blend together the nuts until a smooth nut butter is formed. Scrape down the sides every minute or so. This should take about 5-10 minutes<br><br>

- Then, choose your flavor, and blend in the rest of the ingredients with the salt (optional, depending on the saltiness of your nuts), sweetener (liquid monk fruit or stevia), and protein powder (unflavored whey)<br><br>

- Strawberry Mint - use pistachios as your nut, along with 4 oz (113 g) strawberries, 2 tbsp (30 g) unsweetened applesauce, and a drop of mint extract (doesn't register in the food database for some reason, so it's not included in the ingredient's list above.  Sorry).  Be very careful with the mint extract, you only need a tiny bit<br><br>
