Description: Dessert hummus is a great sweet way to enjoy chickpeas. It works really well as a spread on <a href="ww-bread">100% Whole Wheat Bread</a>, on a PBJ, or in your morning oatmeal. They're naturally sweetened with both bananas and some liquid monk fruit or stevia. Each serving is about 2 tbsp, or 32g.
Instructions: 
- The day before, break your bananas into 1" chunks, and add to an airtight bag.  Freeze overnight<br><br>

- Drain and rinse your chickpeas.  Add all ingredients to a food processor, and blend until smooth.  If you don't have powdered peanut butter, you can add an additional 2 tbsp (32 g) of peanut butter or tahini<br><br>

- Store in an air tight container in the fridge. Use it anywhere you'd use peanut butter, such as spreading on toast, or in your oatmeal.
