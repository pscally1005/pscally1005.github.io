Description: This is less of a recipe and more of a method, as you'd probably use pumpkin puree in something else. Try replacing mashed bananas or unsweetened applesauce in my baked goods with this for a delicious fall twist.<br>&emsp;Similar is my <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a>, which can also be used just like pumpkin puree!  Below are some great pumpkin or sweet potato recipes that you can use your puree on:<br><ul>

Instructions: 
- Wash the pumpkin, cut off the stem, and slice in half.  Scoop out the seeds with a spoon<br><br>

- Place the pumpkin halves cut side down on a parchment line baking sheet, and roast at 400F until fork tender (about 45 minutes).  Flip over to let steam out for a few minutes<br><br>

- Cut off the ends, and transfer to a food processor (with the skins!!).  Blend until smooth<br><br>

- My whole raw pumpkin weighed 764 g, and I ended up with 368 g of puree.  That's about 1.5 cups or 3 servings of 1/2 cup (120 g)
