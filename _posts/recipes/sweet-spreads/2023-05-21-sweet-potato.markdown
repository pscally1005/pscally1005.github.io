Description: This is less of a recipe and more of a method, as you'd probably use sweet potato puree in something else. Try replacing mashed bananas or unsweetened applesauce in my baked goods with this for a delicious fall twist.<br>&emsp;Similar is my <a href="/recipes/pumpkin-puree">Homemade Pumpkin Puree</a>, which can also be used just like sweet potato puree!  Below are some great pumpkin or sweet potato recipes that you can use your puree on:<br><ul>

Instructions: 
- Wash the potatoes. Prick with a fork on all over about 10 times, and wrap in aluminum foil<br><br>

- Bake in the oven for 90 minutes at 400F until very soft. You can also use the air fryer at 400F for 1 hour. Slice open, and allow to steam out for a few minutes<br><br>

- Cut off the ends, and transfer the rest of the potatoes (with the skins!!) to a food processor.  Blend until smooth<br><br>

- You can also turn this into mashed potatoes. Season to taste with garlic and onion powder, pepper, salt, paprika, and parsley<br><br>
