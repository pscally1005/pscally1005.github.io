Description: Chickpea brownies, my original protein based dessert, that I think I have refined to near perfection. These bars are a great protein and fiber packed snack to take on the go. They're much less sweet than traditional brownies, as they're more of a baked protein bar, but I personally prefer the almond and banana taste that these provide. Don't count out the beans until you try them!  For more protein packed chickpea desserts, make this high protein cookie dough - <a href="chickpea-chows">Chickpea Chows</a>
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse your beans, and blend all ingredients in a food processor until fully combined and smooth<br><br>

- The following are some ingredients swaps that I've done, all to great success:<br>- Any kind of beans will work.  Normally I use chickpeas, but I've also made them with black, kidney, cannellini, and pinto beans with no difference<br>- My canned beans are salted, but unsalted will work.  Just add another 1/8 tsp salt to the batter<br>- I've gone with a 50/50 blend (30 g each) of whey and casein, but either all casein or all whey (60 g) will work as well<br>- If you have flavored protein powder, either reduce or omit the honey.  Adjust the batter to your tastes<br>- Any liquid sweetener will work in place of honey, like maple syrup, sugar free syrup, or <a href="/misc/homemade-fruit-syrup">Homemade Fruit Syrup</a><br>- You can also use liquid stevia or monk fruit.  Replace the honey with about 2 tsp (10 g) of liquid monk fruit or stevia.  Again, taste the batter and just the sweetness to your personal preferences<br>- Unsweetened applesauce or <a href="/recipes/apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> will work in place of ripe bananas<br>- Feel free to use any natural nut or seed butter in place of peanut butter.  Good options are almond butter, cashew butter, tahini, or sunflower butter<br>- I've used both immitation vanilla and almond extract, but if you use real extracts, you may want to cut the amounts in half<br><br>

- Line a 9x13‚Äù baking pan with parchment paper and lightly spray it. Pour batter in, and even out. Bake for 50 minutes at 350F, covered, until a toothpick comes out almost clean<br><br>

- Move to the fridge and let cool for around an hour. Cut into slices and store in a ziploc bag or airtight container in either the fridge or the freezer<br><br>

- Optionally, you can also make a frosting with the following ingredients and spread on top of the brownies, or use it to make a layer cake:<br>- Non fat cottage cheese (1 cup, 226 g)<br>- Unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup, 60 g)<br>- Powdered peanut butter (10 tbsp, 60 g)<br>- Almond extract (1 tsp, 5 g)<br><br>You can also use my recipe for <a href="banana-bread-hummus">Banana Bread Hummus Spread</a> as a frosting too!<br><br>

- For a cake, bake the batter in 2 8" pans for about 40 minutes, covered. Spread the frosting on the middle layer, the top, and down the sides. Dust the top with cocoa powder<br><br>
