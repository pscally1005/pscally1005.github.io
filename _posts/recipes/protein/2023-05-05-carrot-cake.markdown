Description: Carrot cake is my personal favorite dessert, outside of <a href="rainbow-cookies">Italian Rainbow Cookies</a>. Which is why I was most interested in making this variation, and I am very happy with the result. Roasting the carrots beforehand really brings the flavor to a whole new level, and it also ensures that you won't have little carrot bits in your cake or mouth.
Instructions: 
- Cut the carrots into strips. Lightly season with salt and oil and roast for 30 minutes at 400F. Blend in a food processor to make the carrot "puree"<br><br>

- Lower your oven to 350F, and line 2 8" cake pans with parchment paper (or aluminum foil). Liberally spray the paper as well<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients - oat flour, casein, whey, cinnamon, ginger, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt<br><br>

- To a separate bowl, add the wet ingredients (eggs, applesauce, yogurt, vanilla, and liquid stevia) and the carrot puree. Mix until fully combine<br><br>

- Mix the dry and the wet ingredients together. Optionally fold in some chopped nuts (1/2 cup, 45 g) <br><br>

- Divide the batter evenly between the 2 baking pans. Smooth out the top<br><br>

- Bake for about 25 minutes at 350F. A toothpick to the center should come out clean, and the internal temperature should be around 205F. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely in the fridge<br><br>

- In a bowl, prepare the frosting - whipped cottage cheese, applesauce, lemon juice, whey, almond extract, and liquid stevia (or monk fruit).  If you want it a little sweeter, you can also add 1 tbsp (20 g) maple syrup or honey<br><br>
