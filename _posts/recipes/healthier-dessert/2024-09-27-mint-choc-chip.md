Description: Delicious cookies made from a base of beans, dates, and sunflower butter!  These are a variation of my <a href="/recipes/chocolate-chip-date-cookies">Chocolate Chip Date Cookies</a>, with added mint extract for the classic mint and chocolate combination.  They're sugar free, nut free, oil free, gluten free, and vegan.  They're even dye free, as I skipped out on the green food dye to make these cookies more wholesome.  For other variations, you should see my <a href="/recipes/double-chocolate-date-cookies">Double Chocolate Date Cookies</a> and my <a href="/recipes/peanut-butter-date-cookies">Peanut Butter Date Cookies</a>.  Or make them all and taste test them to see which ones you like the best!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper<br><br>

- Add the beans, dates, sunflower seed butter, water, mint extract, and salt to a food processor and blend until smooth.  Be very careful with the mint extract, as it's very strong.  Start with half the amount, and adjust to your tastes<br><br>

- For the beans, I've gone with pinto beans, but any other light colored bean will work, like chickpeas, navy beans, or cannellini beans.  I wouldn't recommend black or kidney beans, as the color will change<br><br>

- Add in baking soda and blend briefly, until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips with a silicone spatula. The batter should be very loose for a cookie dough.  You can refrigerate for about 30 minutes to harden it if you desire<br><br>

- Using a cookie scoop (mine is 1.5 tbsp), scoop the cookie dough onto to the pan. These cookies won't flatten or spread as they bake, and will only puff up slightly. Flatten to as wide as you'd like the finished cookies to be<br><br>

- Bake for about 14 minutes at 350F, or until the tops and edges are set to the touch<br><br>
