Description: Coconut macaroons are such a simple healthy dessert, and are great for all you coconut lovers out there. I personally don't like coconut, but even I admit these are hay in the needle stack. To use up those extra yolks though, check out my <a href="hollandaise">Greek Yogurt Hollandaise Sauce</a>
Instructions: 
- With a hand mixer, beat together egg whites until soft peaks in a glass bowl.  Carton egg white will work as well.  66 g is about 4 tbsp + 1 tsp<br><br>

- Fold in honey, vanilla, almond extract, and salt. Mix in coconut and oats until fully combined and sticky.  Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes to harden<br><br>

- Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Use a cookie scoop to scoop the dough, and press it down with your hands in the scoop.  Place onto the sheet, and you should have nice sphere-like cookies.  Shape with your fingers if needed<br><br>

- Bake at 325F for 15 minutes. Cookies will be lightly browned in the top and golden/dark on the bottom. Transfer to a wire rack to cool<br><br>
