Description: Apple Pie might be one of my all time favorite desserts. I love the combination of apples and cinnamon; fruit based desserts are seriously underrated. Here is my healthy take on it, which is gluten free, sugar free, nut free, and vegan. It's a delicious and healthy treat that is perfectly sweet from the apples and has a great nutty flavor from the oat flour crust
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 325F and take out an 8" circular pan<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mix together the crust ingredients (oat flour, sweetener, melted coconut oil, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt) until fully combined. The mix should be a little dry, but come together if you press it with your hands<br><br>

- Press the pie crust evenly into your pan, bringing the crust up the sides (if you can, I didn't have enough here) and making sure everything is as packed as possible. Optionally, reserve some crust for a topping (if you have enough)<br><br>

- Blind bake the pie shell for 10 minutes at 325F. Refrigerate to cool as you prepare the filling<br><br>

- Wash your apples (don't peel them!), thinly slice (about 1/4-1/2 inch thick), and add to a large bowl. Add in the rest of the filling ingredients, and mix until fully combined - sweetener, cornstarch, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cloves, and salt<br><br>

- Increase your oven temperature to 350F, and add the filling to the pie crust. Evenly spread out the apples, and top with any remaining crust mix for a crumble topping<br><br>

- Cover with aluminum foil, and bake for about 60 minutes at 350F, until the apples are tender, soft, and syrupy, but not mushy<br><br>
