Description: Here is a giant chocolate chip cookie. Because that's what cookie cake is. I've made it added sugar free and gluten free, utilizing dates, chickpeas, bananas, peanut butter, and oats. This dessert is like eating a large chocolate chip cookie with a fork, and goes great with a scoop of <a href="neopolitan-banana-ice-cream">Neopolitan Banana Ice Cream</a> right on top of it
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F, and lightly grease a 10" cast iron pan with oil<br><br>

- In a small bowl, cover your dates with hot water, and let soak for 10 minutes to soften. Drain the soaking liquid, and transfer to a food processor<br><br>

- To the food processor with the dates, add an entire can of chickpeas (NOT drained or rinsed), bananas, and peanut butter (or any other nut/seed butter). Blend until smooth, and no chunks remain. Transfer to a large bowl<br><br>

- With a silicone spatula, mix in almond (or vanilla) baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix in the oat flour until fully combined. Fold in half the chocolate chips, reserving the rest for the top<br><br>
