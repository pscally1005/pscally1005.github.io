Description: These delicious chocolate chip peanut butter blondies use sweet potatoes as a base, leaving them rich, delicious, and slightly cakey with much less fat and sugar. You can swap out the chocolate chips for chopped nuts or seeds to make them a breakfast bar too!  You can use either <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a>, or just use canned pumpkin puree.  For more sweet potato based desserts, see my fudgy <a href="sweet-potato-brownies">Sweet Potato Brownies (SF)</a>
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients (except chocolate chips) with a hand mixer until smooth and thoroughly mixed.  Fold in the chocolate chips with a spatula<br><br>

- For more peanut butter flavor and protein, replace the oat flour with powdered peanut butter.  To turn into a brownie instead (pictured below), replace the oat flour with cocoa powder<br><br>

- I've recently found these no sugar dark chocolate chips by <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Bake-Believe-Keto-Friendly-Dark-Chocolate-Chips-9-oz-Pouch/314343390?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Bake Believe</a> at Walmart that are my favorite sugar free chocolate chips.  They use erythritol and stevia, and are cheaper than any other sugar free chocolate chip brand I've seen (sometimes they're even cheaper than the fancy brands of regular sugar filled chocolate chips).  They also come in milk chocolate and semi sweet varieties.  Not an ad; just a fan<br><br>

- Line an 8" square baking pan with parchment paper, and lightly spray the paper.  Transfer the batter to the pan with a silicone spatula, smoothing out the top.  Optionally, top with a few extra chocolate chips<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown and set. A toothpick should come out almost clean, and the internal temperature will be around 190F<br><br>

- Let cool in the pan in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before slicing with a plastic knife
