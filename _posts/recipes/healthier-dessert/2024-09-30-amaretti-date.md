Description: Amaretti cookies have long been one of my favorite desserts, being a staple at Italian holidays.  They're pretty simple to make healthy though, as they are traditionally free of any butter, oil, or highly processed flours.  Just swap the sugar for any other sweetener - see my <a href="/recipes/amaretti">Amaretti Cookies with Monkfruit</a>.<br>&emsp;But today, I wanted to make a more naturally sweetened version, instead of using highly processed (albeit sugar-free) sweeteners like granulated monk fruit.  This recipe is more similar to my <a href="/recipes/date-cookies">Almond Flour Cookies</a>, but with almond extract instead of chocolate chip.  These are a bit softer than the traditional amaretti cookies, but are still full of the same great flavor while containing no added sugar!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper<br><br>

- Add all ingredients to a food processor, and blend until smooth and no visible chunks of dates are remaining. You will have to stop and scrape down the sides a few times<br><br>

- Use a cookie scoop (mine is 1.5 tbsp) to scoop the batter onto your lined pan. Lightly wet your hands to shape the cookies into round balls if necessary. Don't flatten the cookies, you want them to be smaller but taller, instead of wider and flat<br><br>
