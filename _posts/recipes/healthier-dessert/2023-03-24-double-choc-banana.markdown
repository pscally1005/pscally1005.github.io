Description: <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#banana-bread">Banana bread</a> is a great dessert for a crowd, and this healthy chocolate banana bread is a great way to still feel your best at sweets time. This dessert is minimally sweetened with honey, and fully brings out the flavor of the bananas and the cocoa for a delicious brownie flavored banana bread.  It's very similar to my <a href="pbj-muffin">Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins</a> and my <a href="banana-bread">Oatmeal Banana Mini Muffins</a>, which you should also check out
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F, and line a bread pan with parchment paper. Spray the inside of the paper as well<br><br>

- Whisk together dry ingredients (oat flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt) in a bowl<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, mash a banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients (yogurt, <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">nut butter</a>, applesauce, egg, and honey) to the bowl and mix<br><br>

- Any kind of nut butter, like peanut or almond, will work.  For a nut free version, use pumpkin seed or sunflower seed butter<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and combine with a silicone spatula.  Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 350F for about 60 minutes. A toothpick should come out slightly dirty, and the internal temperature will be around 190F<br><br>

- Alternatively, you can bake these as either mini muffins (makes 40) or standard size muffins (makes 12).  Bake at 350F until the internal temperature is around 200F, and a toothpick comes out clean.  About 12 minutes for the mini muffins or about 22 minutes for the standard size<br><br>

- Let cool completely in the fridge for about an hour, then slice
