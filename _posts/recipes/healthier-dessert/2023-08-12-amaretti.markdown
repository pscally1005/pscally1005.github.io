Description: Amaretti cookies are an Italian classic at any holiday, and always my favorite dessert at the table.  This recipe is identical to the traditional, except with granulated sugar swapped for monk fruit.  Or you can make my <a href="/recipes/amaretti-cookies-with-dates">Amaretti Cookies with Dates</a> instead if you prefer a more naturally sweetened version.  Both are gluten free, don't have any butter or oil, and get their healthy fats from almonds.  To use up those leftover yolks, whip up a quick <a href="hollandaise">Greek Yogurt Hollandaise Sauce</a>
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mix together the almond flour, sweetener, and salt<br><br>

- In a separate bowl (glass or metal), beat the egg whites on high speed until medium to stiff peaks. Add the extracts to the eggs and beat to mix<br><br>

- Gently fold the egg mixture into the flour mixture with a rubber spatula. Mix gently to just combine. Chill dough in the fridge for an hour<br><br>

- Preheat the oven to 325F and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a small bowl, add the powdered sweetener.<br><br>

- Roll each cookie into a small ball and place on baking sheet.  Roll the cookies in sweetener, and place back on the cookie sheet. Lightly flatten with your fingers<br><br>

- Bake for 12-13 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through. Let cool on pan for 5 minutes, or until you can safely lift them up.  Transfer to a cooling rack<br><br>
