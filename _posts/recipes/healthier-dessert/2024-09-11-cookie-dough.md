Description: Who else agrees that raw cookie dough is better than the actual baked cookies? This cookie dough is sugar free, vegan, and gluten free. Instead, it's sweetened with dates, and uses almond flour as the base. I've used some sugar free dark chocolate chips here as well, and no you cannot taste the beans!  For a baked versions, check out my <a href="/recipes/date-cookies">Almond Flour Cookies</a> or <a href="/recipes/chocolate-chip-date-cookies">Chocolate Chip Date Cookies</a>
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse your can of beans. I've used cannellini here, but any light colored beans (like chickpeas, pinto beans, or navy beans) will also work well<br><br>

- Add beans, dates, nut butter, vanilla, and almond milk to your food processor, and blend until almost smooth<br><br>

- When all the dates are fully blended and no longer visible, add almond flour and blend into a cookie dough consistency<br><br>

- Fold in chocolate chips with a silicone spatula<br><br>

- Using a cookie scoop (mine is 1.5 tbsp and makes ~20 g cookies), scoop cookie dough onto a parchment paper lined plate. Freeze to harden, then store in an airtight container in the freezer or fridge
