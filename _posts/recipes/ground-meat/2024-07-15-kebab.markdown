Description: These simple kebabs are made with ground turkey (either beef or lamb will work as well), and they can be cooked inside on a pan or grilled outdoors. The simple combination of lean meats and spices makes this a super quick and delicious summer main that pairs well with some <a href="/recipes/salmon-and-tzatziki">tzatziki</a>. Nutrition facts are for a serving size of 2 skewers/patties
Instructions: 
- In a small bowl, whisk together the spices - garlic powder, onion powder, allspice, black pepper, turmeric, oregano, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and cloves<br><br>

- In a large bowl, combine together the spice mix, finely diced onion, fresh dill, and ground meat.  Optionally, you can sautee the onion with a pinch of salt until translucent for extra flavor<br><br>

- Divide the meat into 8 pieces. Either make 8 patties for cooking inside, or 8 skewers for grilling.  You can also use skewers for inside cooking too if you have a big enough pan. Brush or spray the outside of the meat with olive oil<br><br>
