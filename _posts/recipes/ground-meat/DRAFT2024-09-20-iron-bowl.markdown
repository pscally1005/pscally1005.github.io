Description: If you read through my post <a href="/misc/iron">I Run on Iron</a>, you'll know that ground beef, spinach, lentils, and pumpkin seeds are all very high sources of iron.  This bowl of food packs 12.98 mg (72% DV) of iron, as well as being a great source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. It's also loaded with magnesium, calcium, potassium, zinc, phosphorus, B vitamins, and vitamins E and K, all while tasting delicious and having 56 g of protein per serving.  The flavor profile is very similar to my <a href="/recipes/lebanese-casserole">Lebanese Riced Cauliflower Casserole</a>, but with red lentils and pumpkin seeds in place of cauliflower rice and pine nuts
Instructions: 
- Lentils - In a medium pot, add your lentils, water, and chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and let cook for about 6 minutes. See my <a href="/recipes/red-lentils">Easy Red Lentils</a> for a full breakdown on cooking lentils<br><br>

- Spinach - Heat a 12" nonstick pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add your spinach and spices (garlic, onion, cumin, lemon pepper, and black pepper), and cook (covered) until the water has cooked off and the spinach just begins to stick to the pan (about 10 minutes)<br><br>

- Meat - Heat a 10" cast iron pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add your spinach, and brown the meat. When no longer pink, season with soy sauce, garlic, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves<br><br>

- Seeds - Once the lentils, spinach, and beef are finished, assemble into bowl, and use one of your pans to toast the pumpkin seeds on medium heat for about 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Top each bowl with the seeds, and enjoy<br><br>
