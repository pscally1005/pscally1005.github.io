Description: I bet you've never had a healthy mac and cheese before.  This dish is still cheesy and creamy while packing 46 g of protein and in 500 calories per serving.  You can add even more bulk by adding more vegetables like peppers or broccoli, but I wanted to keep it more traditional here.  To elevate this, make it a BBQ Mac & Cheese with sugar free BBQ sauce, or top it with breadcrumbs and broil the top for crispiness
Instructions: 
- Cook your pasta according to instructions. Strain, rinse with cold water, and set aside<br><br>

- Meanwhile, preheat a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat with oil. Cut your onions into a small dice, and add to the pot with salt. Cover, and cook until translucent, about 5-8 minutes<br><br>

- Add the meat to the pot, and cook until no longer pink. Season with chili powder and black pepper. Remove from the heat<br><br>

- Meanwhile, prepare your cheese sauce by blending together all the ingredients - cottage cheese, shredded cheese, milk, nutritional yeast, cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika<br><br>

- Combine the cheese sauce and pasta with the meat in the pot. Transfer to a 9x13" pan, and optionally top with BBQ sauce or breadcrumbs<br><br>

- Cover, and bake at 400F until bubbly. This will take about 10 minutes if baking right away, or 30 minutes if preparing ahead of time, refrigerating, and baking later<br><br>
