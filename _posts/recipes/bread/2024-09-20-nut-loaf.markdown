Description: This Norwegian bread is naturally Paleo, vegan, and gluten free. It's a simple to make and nutritious bread that's full of healthy fats, fiber, and a decent bit of protein from all the nuts and seeds. As opposed to regular bread, this loaf is dense, crunchy, and chewy, but still delicious when toasted.  It's very versatile, going well topped with hummus, avocado, peanut butter, jam, used for a sandwich, or crumbled onto a salad.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a 9x5" bread pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a food processor, blend the raisins and almonds until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl<br><br>

- Add the rest of the dry ingredients to the bowl, and whisk together (or mix with your hands) - flax, oats, sunflower, pumpkin, chia, psyllium, and salt. Optionally, mix in some cinnamon<br><br>

- Add the applesauce (or melted coconut oil) to the bowl, and mix in with the nuts. Optionally, mix in some vanilla or almond extract<br><br>

- Warm your water in the microwave to about 100F, and mix into the bowl until you have a thick dough and everything is just soaked<br><br>

- Transfer to your bread pan, and press down into a dense, even layer. Place a piece of parchment paper on top, and use it to press the dough down as dense as possible . Smooth out the top<br><br>

- Let cool completely before slicing. Cut into thin slices with a serrated knife. Don't worry, the slices hold together way better than you'd expect them to<br><br>
