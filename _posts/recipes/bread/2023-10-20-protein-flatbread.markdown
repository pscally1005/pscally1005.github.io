Description: This flatbread is a variation of 2 ingredient dough, with added spices and using some protein powder in place of flour. The casein and oat flour combo gives a great mix of protein and fiber, and they taste great together, especially with the added garlic and onion powder. This can be cooked on the stove as a flatbread, or baked into a pizza. This bread is best served warm.
Instructions: 
- Mix flours, baking powder, salt, garlic, and onion in a medium bowl. Add in the yogurt and mix until fully combined<br><br>

- Combine with your hands in the bowl until you get a dough ball

- Take a cold 10 inch pan and flatten with your fingers to the edges. Cook over medium low heat until lightly browned on both sides.  This only takes a few minutes.  Do not overcook, as too much browning of casein won't taste good<br><br>

- You can also use this dough as a pizza.  Lightly cook for a few minutes on the stove on each side, top with sauce and cheese, and cover to warm the sauce and melt the cheese<br><br>
