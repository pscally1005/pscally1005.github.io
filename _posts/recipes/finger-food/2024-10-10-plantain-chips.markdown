Description: These plantain chips are healthy, crunchy, and great with any dip, like <a href="/recipes/classic-tahini-hummus">Classic Tahini Hummus</a> or <a href="/recipes/ketchup">Date Sweetened Ketchup</a>. They're the best replacement for standard chips while still feeling like the real deal (sorry sliced peppers and carrots, you're great too).  Using a mandoline, you can air fry any starchy vegetable until crispy, not just plantains.  Beets and sweet potatoes make great options too!
Instructions: 
- Cut the ends off the plantain, and peel with a knife. Using a mandoline set to 1.5 mm (1/16") thickness, thinly slice your plantain, and add to a medium bowl. Drizzle with oil, and season with garlic, onion, salt, and turmeric.  You can see my plantain here is definitely more yellow than green; try to get as green as possible, as it will make the chips easier to slice and they'll turn out crispier.  The more yellow it is, the sweeter they will be, but they'll be softer, break apart, and not get crispy<br><br>

- Lightly spray the basket with oil. Arrange in a SINGLE layer in your air fryer basket (you will need to fry in multiple batches). Lightly spray the tops with oil.  I over-crowded them here; try to have none of them touching<br><br>

- Air fry at 350F for about 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown, but not burnt.  You can also bake in a 350F oven for 25-30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and crisp.  Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge<br><br>
