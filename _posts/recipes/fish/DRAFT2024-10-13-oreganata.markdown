Description: This shrimp oreganata utilizes a homemade breadcrumb mix made of oat flour, grated cheese, and ground flaxseeds. It's gluten free, delicious, and cheaper than store-bought GF breadcrumbs. This meal comes together very quickly, and is a great light and healthy meal that serves 4. Pair it with a side of roasted veggies, and you have a complete dish
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 450F, and grease a 9x13" pan with a spray of oil<br><br>

- In a large mixing bowl, combine together the breadcrumb ingredients - oat flour, grated cheese, minced garlic, ground flax, parsley, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Set aside<br><br>

- Rinse the shrimp under cold water and transfer to a paper towel lined plate. Peel off the shells and tails (if applicable), and pat dry<br><br>

- In a bowl, toss the shrimp with the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Arrange in a single layer in your pan<br><br>

- Bake at 450F for 10 minutes, then broil for 2-3, or until the breadcrumbs are golden brown. Watch carefully while broiling; you don't want to burn it. Squeeze some lemon juice to taste on top<br><br>
