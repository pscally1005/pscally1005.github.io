Description: Who else loves ketchup, but hates all the sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup that it contains?  This simple sauce uses the sweetness of dates to deliver that traditional ketchup taste without being loaded with added sugars and other ultra-processed ingredients.<br>&emsp;Everyone knows that ketchup goes great with burgers and fries, so check out my <a href="/recipes/burger-patties">Simple Burger Patties</a> and <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-fries">Spiced Sweet Potato Fries</a>, or turn it into a bowl with my <a href="/recipes/burger-bowl">Chopped Burger Bowl with Sweet Potatoes</a>.  If you instead want some barbeque sauce, you should see my <a href="/recipes/bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a>
Instructions: 
- Roughly chop your dates, and add all ingredients to a medium stainless steel saucepot. Simmer on medium low heat with occasional stirring for 10-15 minutes, then blend until smooth with an immersion blender<br><br>

- If you want to turn this into BBQ sauce instead, just add some paprika, cumin, and cinnamon along with the other ingredients
