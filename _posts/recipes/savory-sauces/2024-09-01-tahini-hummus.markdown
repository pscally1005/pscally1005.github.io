Description: I love hummus, and I have plenty of different varieties.  From different spice combinations to various roasted vegetables, hummus is my go to spread, dip, and dressing.  But today, after finding some tahini on sale, I decided I should make some classic hummus.  This is a plain hummus flavor that can serve as a base for any other ideas, or stand on its own for your toast, veggie sticks, or salads.  Each serving is about 2 tbsp, or 30 g<br>&emsp;Check out some of my other flavors of hummus as well!  They're all either contain either low or no oil, making them lower in fat and calories than traditional.  I have plenty of differnent flavors coming from various spices, roasted vegetables, differnet nut and seed butters, and even different beans:<br>- <a href="/recipes/creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-red-pepper-hummus">Roasted Red Pepper Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-garlic-hummus">Cheesy Garlic Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-hummus">Golden Sweet Potato Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-eggplant-hummus">Mediterranean Roasted Eggplant Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/ginger-hummus">Ginger Lime Black Bean Hummus</a><br>- <a href="/recipes/hummus">Lemony Taco Inspired Hummus</a>
Instructions: 
- Drain your chickpeas through a strainer into a bowl, saving the liquid.  This liquid is called aquafaba, and we will be using some of it later in the hummus to make it creamier<br><br>

- Add your chickpeas, tahini, and lemon juice to a food processor, and blend until smooth<br><br>

- Season with garlic, cumin, and salt.  Blend in aquafaba until creamy.  Garnish with paprika and parsley, and serve
