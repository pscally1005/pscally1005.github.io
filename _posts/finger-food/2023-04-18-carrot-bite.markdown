Description: These bites take the idea of a carrot cake and simplify them down to bite sized pieces. They are naturally sweetened with honey, and the perfect snack to take on the go for a quick energy boost. the yogurt, so if you're not a fan of Greek yogurt, I'd recommend you replace it with mashed avocado or banana.
Instructions: 
- Cut carrots into thin strips. Add to a sheet pan with olive oil and salt, and roast for 25 minutes at 425F, stirring halfway. Add to a food processor and blend until a puree<br><br>

- Add the other ingredients to a food processor and blend until mixture turns into a dough-like consistency. You can also mix in a bowl if your food processor is too small to fit it all, as long as you blend up the carrots. Refrigerate until you can shape it without too much sticking<br><br>

- With the small spoon scoop the mixture and roll into balls and place in an airtight container. Store in the fridge or the freezer
