Description: These super simple croutons are made using cannellini beans (or any other beans you have).  Depending on your soy sauce, they can be a great gluten free alternative, as well as being healthier than traditional croutons.  Just air fry or roast the beans until crispy, as use them to top a salad.  They go great with my <a href="/recipes/greek-yogurt-caesar-dressing">Greek Yogurt Caesar Dressing</a>
Instructions: 
- Drain and rinse your beans, and add to a medium bowl. Add in the rest of the ingredients (soy sauce, garlic powder, oregano, and paprika), and toss to combine<br><br>

- Air fry at 400F for 15-20 minutes, mixing halfway. You can also bake in a 400F oven instead for 30-45 minutes.  The whole batch (cooked) weighs about 100 g, so each serving is about 33 g<br><br>

- The cover photo for this recipe is a Caesar salad I made by tossing together half a large head of Romaine lettuce, 1 serving of my <a href="/recipes/greek-yogurt-caesar-dressing">Greek Yogurt Caesar Dressing</a>, 1 serving (33 g) of these croutons, and 1/2 oz (15 g) crumbled feta cheese
