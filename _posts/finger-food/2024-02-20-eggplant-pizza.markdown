Description: These low carb eggplant Pizzas are perfect little bite sized appetizers to serve to a group. They're really easy to make, just pre roast the eggplant, add toppings, and bake again. I'll be making this alongside a regular pizza for pizza night in my house for now on. I made about 20 mini pizzas with a large eggplant
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 425F, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut your eggplant into 1/2" rounds, and add to the sheet. Season with salt, pepper, and oil, and roast for 15 minutes, until browned<br><br>

- Remove the eggplant from the oven, and top with sauce, cheese, and a dash of oregano on each pizza<br><br>

- Bake for another 10-12 minutes, or until browned to your liking. You can also broil the top for a minute or 2 to brown the cheese
