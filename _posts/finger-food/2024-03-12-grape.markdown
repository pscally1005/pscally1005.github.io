Description: Stuffed Grape Leaves are something I occasionally get at Greek restaurants, and I love them every time.  I've tried to recreate that feeling in my kitchen, and I think they've turned out pretty well.  They're great on their own, or dipped in <a href="hummus">hummus</a> or <a href="salmon-and-tzatziki">tzatziki</a>.  This pairs well as a side to a grilled chicken pocket pita, or some roasted fish with lemon.  It's a lot of work on your own, but a fun activity with a partner or group of people
Instructions: 
- Rinse your rice under cold water in a fine mesh strainer. In a medium pot, add rice, water, and bouillon. Cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium low, and let simmer for 30-45 minutes, or until fully cooked. This will depend on your brand of rice. Set aside<br><br>

- Using a strainer, drain and rinse your jar of grape leaves. I bough a 16 oz jar, and probably used about half of it.  Set aside<br><br>

- Cut your onion into a fine dice. To a large pan over medium heat, add onion, oil, and salt. Cover, and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Add in the meat, and cook until fully browned. Season with lemon pepper, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg. Take off the heat<br><br>

- Finely chop your dill, and add to a large bowl.  An ounce of chopped dill should be around a cup or so. Combine with the rice and meat mixtures<br><br>

- To stuff the grape leaves, place the leaf on a cutting board with the rough side up. Take about 1 tbsp of filling per leaf, and place in the center. Fold in the sides, and roll over to create a tightly wrapped mini burrito, with the seam side down<br><br>

- Neatly arrange them (seam side down) in a large pot. Pour water (or broth) over the grape leaves, until just covered. Place an inverted plate on top to prevent them from rising<br><br>

- Cover the pot with a lid, and cook over medium heat for about 30 minutes<br><br>

- Let cool for 30 minutes before eating<br><br>

- If you have extra grape leaves, you can finely chop them and add them to a salad
