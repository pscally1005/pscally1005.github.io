Description: These healthy oat flour crackers are gluten free, and somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker. They're made with only a little amount of fat and sugar, and go great with anything savory or sweet. If you wanted to use them for s'mores, simply just cut them into bigger pieces
Instructions: 
- In a large glass bowl, melt the peanut butter. Add all ingredients to a bowl and mix with a wooden spoon. Gently knead a few times<br><br>
