Description: These super simple 4 ingredients gluten free snacks are made in just 5 minutes, and are a good quick source of fiber, carbs, and healthy fats, helping you get through the day.  They're offer a quick boost of energy through the peanut butter, oat flour, cocoa powder, and honey.  They're much cheaper than other minimal ingredient healthy snacks on the market as well
Instructions: 
- In a bowl or small food processor, combine together all the ingredients until fully combined - peanut butter, oat flour, cocoa powder, and honey<br><br>

- Here are some substitutions if you need:<br>- Any kind of nut butter will work (peanut, almond, pistachio, sunflower, etc.)<br>- You can use maple syrup or sugar free syrup instead of honey<br>- Cacao powder or carob powder will also work in place of cocoa powder<br><br>

- Line a small airtight continer with parchment paper, and press in the dough.  Smooth out the top with another piece of parchment paper (to prevent sticking), and refrigerate for a few hours to firm before slicing<br><br>

- Store in the fridge or the freezer
