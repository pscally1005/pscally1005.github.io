Description: These plantain chips are healthy, crunchy, and great to dip in hummus (here I'm dipping in my <a href="creamy-pesto-hummus">Creamy Pesto Hummus</a>). They're the best replacement for standard chips while still feeling like the real deal (sorry sliced peppers and carrots, you're great too)
Instructions: 
- Cut the ends off the plantain, and peel with a knife. Thinly slice your plantain, and add to a medium bowl. Drizzle with oil, and season with garlic, onion, salt, and turmeric<br><Br>

- Lightly spray the basket with oil. Arrange in a single layer in your air fryer basket (you may need to fry in 2 batches). Lightly spray the tops with oil<br><br>

- Air fry at 400F for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown, but not burnt. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and crisp<br><br>

- Note - Ideally, you want a green plantain, and to slice it on a mandoline.  An underripe plantain and very thin cuts will lead to plantain chips that get very crispy.  My plantain was on the yellow/brown end, and I cut them too thick with a knife.  Still delicious, but not very crispy
