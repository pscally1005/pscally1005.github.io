Description: Triscuits only contain 3 ingredients, making it very easy to reverse engineer the recipe from the nutrition facts. All the carbs, sodium, and fat are from the whole wheat flour, salt, and oil respectively, since each ingredient is essentially the only source of those macro and micro nutrients. I've swapped their vegetable oil for healthier EVOO, while still maintaining the whole wheat flour
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt until well combined. Add in spices here too if you'd like.  Optional additions include a teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, or paprika. Pour in the oil and water, and bring together with your hands or a scraper to get a dough<br><br>

- Divide the dough in 4, and roll out each piece as thin as you can make it. Roll out on a piece of parchment paper or a silicone mat. Use a pizza wheel to cut into squares, and use a fork to prick holes in each cracker<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 450F oven for 10 minutes, or until the crackers are medium brown and begin to pull up at the edges.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Store in a sealed back at room temperature<br><br>

- I ended up with about 70 crackers, so a serving is about 8-9 crackers
