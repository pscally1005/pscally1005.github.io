Description: Using your air fryer is a fun way to make a good trail mix, and this one uses roasted chickpeas, paprika spiced nuts, and banana chips. Simply roast all 3 and toss with your desired spices before combing together. It goes great on a salad or a bowl of yogurt, or even on its own!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your air fryer to 400F, and drain and rinse the chickpeas. Lightly spray the bottom of the basket with oil, and add in the chickpeas. Add another light spray of oil on top.<br><br>

- Air fry for about 14 minutes until browned and crispy, flipping halfway and adding another spray of oil. Remove to a bowl, and toss with the spices (hot sauce, garlic and onion powder, and salt). Set aside<br><br>

- Heat air fryer back up to 400F. Again, lightly spray the basket, add the nuts, and top with another light spray<br><br>

- Air fry nuts at 400F for about 5 minutes. Remove to another bowl, and toss with the paprika and soy sauce. Set aside<br><br>

- Lower the air fryer to 350F. Slice your banana very thin, about 1/4" thick. Lightly spray the basket, and add the banana. Lightly spray the top<br><br>

- Air fry at 350F for about 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove the base of the air fryer and use as a cooling rack until the bananas are completely cooled. This is why I did the banana last, so I didn't have to take soft bananas out of the air fryer. Toss with the oil, cinnamon, and salt when totally cooled.<br><br>

- Mix the 3 bowls together, and break up the banana chips as small as the nuts and chickpeas. Transfer to a Ziploc bag and store in the fridge
