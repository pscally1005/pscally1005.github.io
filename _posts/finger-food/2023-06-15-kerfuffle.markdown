Description: These "kerfuffles", or confusing truffles, are a great Greek yogurt based chocolate truffle, with much lower fat and sugar contents than typical truffles. They mix together in just a few minutes, and store really well in the fridge for a quick snack or dessert. These really bring out the flavor of the yogurt, so if you're not a fan of Greek yogurt, I'd recommend you replace it with mashed avocado or banana.
Instructions: 
- In a glass bowl, melt the coconut oil in the microwave for a minute<br><br>

- To the bowl, add the yogurt and mix with a spoon until smooth. Add in the rest of the ingredients and mix to fully combine. The dough should be a little sticky, so chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour to firm<br><br>

- Roll into truffles, and place in an airtight container or bag. Store in the fridge
