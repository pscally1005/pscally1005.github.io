Description: Chicken Fingers and French Fries are a classic for a reason. They're often not gluten free however, and they're deep fried in harmful oils. This recipe fixed both of those by breading in homemade oat flour, and roasting in an air fryer. It pairs well with my Broccoli Fries for a crunchy and nutritious meal<br><p><a href="broccoli-fries">Air Fryer Broccoli Fries</a></p>
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mix together your breading of oat flour, Parmesan cheese, and spices - paprika, chili, oregano, thyme, basil, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, ginger, and cayenne<br><br>

- Cut the chicken into chicken finger sized pieces, and spray both sides with some oil. If using tenders, you can choose to remove the tendon as well<br><br>

- Add chicken to the breading bowl and coat all the chicken in the mix. Transfer the chicken to a plate<br><br>

- Lightly spray the tops of the chicken with oil, and transfer to an air fryer basket oil side down. Spray the other side now, so both sides have a light spray of oil. Air fry for about 8 minutes at 400F, flipping halfway, or until the chicken reaches 165F<br><br>

- Transfer to a wire rack to keep crispy. You may need to fry in multiple batches
