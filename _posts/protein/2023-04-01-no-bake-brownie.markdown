Description: These no-bake banana brownies are my favorite protein based dessert. The recipe is made in less than 10 minutes and is full of peanut butter, chocolate, and banana flavor. They melt fast in your hands, but I'm sure that won't be an issue because you will have already finished eating it!
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mash the bananas with a fork. Mix in the rest of the ingredients - nut butter (almond or peanut), PB2, whey, cocoa, vanilla, and sweetener<br><br>

- Pour batter into an 8" pan lined with parchment paper. Freeze for about 2-3 hours to fully harden, or overnight<br><br>

- Let sit out on the fridge for a few minutes if needed before slicing into bars.<br><br>
