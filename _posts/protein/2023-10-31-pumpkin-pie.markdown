Description: Alliterations aside, this pumpkin pie is made with a protein powder and oat flour crust, and features a filling of pumpkin puree, liquid monk fruit, and no added sugars. For some healthy fats, mix some chopped nuts into the filling, or sprinkle on top of the pie.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F. Liberally grease a 9" metal pie pan with oil spray<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mash your banana with the back of a fork. Mix in the rest of the crust ingredients - whey, casein, oat flour, cornstarch, monk fruit/stevia, cinnamon, baking powder, and optionally a dash of butter extract<br><br>

- Spread the crust onto the bottom of the pan with a silicone spatula. Make sure the crust is even, and spreads to all sides<br><br>

- In your large bowl, mix together the filling ingredients (pumpkin puree, eggs, water, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, cloves, yogurt, monk fruit or stevia, vanila, and whey). You can add a little butter extract to the filling if you want (as well as the crust)<br><br>

- Bake in a 350F oven for 25 minutes. Lower heat to 300F, and bake for an additional 15 minutes<br><br>

- Let cool completely before slicing, at least a few hours in the fridge to totally set. Optionally, dust the top of the pie with some cinnamon
