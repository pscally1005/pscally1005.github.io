Description: Cottage cheese ice cream is more than just an Internet food trend. It's a protein packed copycat dessert that is filling and satisfied any ice cream cravings. This recipe adds in some protein powder for even more of a protein boost, and can be made in various flavors, like peanut butter or mint chocolate.  For a dairy free healthy ice cream, make some <a href="nice-cream">Banana Nice Cream</a>
Instructions: 
- Mix base ingredients together in a tupperware or small blender - cottage cheese, whey, stevia, and vanilla<br><br>

- Choose a flavor and mix in ingredients.  Here are some example flavors<br>
- <b>Peanut Butter Chocolate</b> - 1 tbsp (16 g) natural peanut butter, 1 tbsp (5 g) cocoa powder, and a dash of almond extract<br>
- <b>Mint Chocolate</b> - 2 drops of mint extract, and 1 tbsp (5 g) cocoa powder<br><br>

- Churn the ice cream every half hour or so for about 2-3 hours. Doing so will prevent it from getting too icy<br><br>

- Store in the freezer. Let sit out for 10 minutes before eating
