Description: Chickpea brownies, my original protein based dessert, that I think I have refined to near perfection. These bars are a great protein and fiber packed snack to take on the go. They're much less sweet than traditional brownies, but I personally prefer the almond and banana taste that these provide. Don't count out the beans until you try them!  For more chickpea desserts, make high protein cookie dough <a href="chickpea-chows">Chickpea Chows</a>
Instructions: 
- Blend all ingredients in a food processor until fully mixed - (drained and rinsed) chickpeas, bananas, yogurt, peanut butter, honey, baking powder, vanilla, stevia/monk fruit, almond extract, salt, cocoa, PB2, and protein powder<br><br>

- Either unflavored whey or casein will work for this recipe.  You can do a 50/50 blend, or just choose one.  Note that the batter with casein will be much thicker than the one with whey.  Other good substitutions are unsweetened applesauce in place of bananas, maple syrup in place of honey, or almond butter in place of peanut butter<br><br>

- Line a 9x13‚Äù baking pan with parchment paper and lightly spray it. Pour batter in, and even out. Bake for 50 minutes at 350F, covered, until a toothpick comes out almost clean<br><br>

- Move to the fridge and let cool for around an hour. Cut into slices and store in a ziploc bag or container in either the fridge or the freezer.<br><br>

- Optionally, you can also make a frosting with the following ingredients and spread on top of the brownies, or use it to make a layer cake<br><br>
- Non fat cottage cheese (1 cup, 226 g)<br>
- Unsweetened applesauce (1/4 cup, 60 g)<br>
- PB2 (10 tbsp, 60 g)<br>
- Almond extract (1 tsp, 5 g)<br><br>
- You can also use my recipe for <a href="banana-bread-hummus">Banana Bread Hummus Spread</a> as a frosting too!<br><br>

- For a cake, bake the batter in 2 8" pans for about 40 minutes, covered. Spread the frosting on the middle layer, the top, and down the sides. Dust the top with cocoa powder<br><br>
