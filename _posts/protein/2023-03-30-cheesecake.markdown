Description: This peanut butter cheesecake is a great gluten free and high protein dessert option. It as work as a protein bar too, as it even has more than 10 of protein per 100 calories. Fold in some chocolate chips or serve with some peanut butter and berries to mix it up.  This cheesecake doesn't have a crust, but if you want one, see my <a href="peanut-butter-pie">Peanut Butter Banana Pie</a> for a standard pie crust, or my <a href="pumpkin-pie">Perfect Protein Packed Pumpkin Pie</a> for a high protein pie crust
Instructions: 
- Mix ingredients together in a bowl or food processor until smooth - whipped fat free cottage cheese, banana, PB2, cornstarch, vanilla, and sweetener<br><br>

- Line an 8‚Äù pie pan with parchment paper and spray. Pour in the mixture and even out. Optionally top with chocolate chips (2 tbsp, 30 g)<br><br>

- Bake for about 25-30 minutes at 350F. The center should lightly jiggle when the side of the pan is tapped. If it jiggles too much, continue to bake for an additional few minutes<br><br>
