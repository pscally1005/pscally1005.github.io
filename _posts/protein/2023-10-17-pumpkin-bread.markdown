Description: Fall season means pumpkin season, and this pumpkin loaf is full of protein, and with a good amount of fiber and healthy fats too. It's a great breakfast or dessert that I think you'll enjoy.
Instructions: 
- Blend all ingredients together in a food processor until smooth - canned pumpkin puree, quick oats, whey, PB2, chia seeds, peanut butter, baking powder, cinnamon, stevia, ginger, nutmeg, baking soda, and water<br><br>

- Transfer batter to a bread pan lined with parchment paper.<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for at least 60 minutes, or a toothpick to the center comes out clean. Let cook on a wire rack before slicing.<br><br>
