Description: RX Bars are one of the prepackaged snacks that I will occasionally buy, as they're pretty healthy with their protein powder and lack of ultra processed ingredients. They are quite pricey though, so I prefer to make them myself. They're dead simple, and way cheaper than what you can get at the store.
Instructions: 
- Prepare an 8" square baking dish by lining it with parchment paper. Soak your dates in hot water for about 10 minutes to soften. Set aside the water<br><br>

- Blend in the cocoa and protein powder for about 30 seconds, or until fully incorporated.<br><br>

- Finally, blend in the dates. Season with salt to taste. You should have a sticky but workable dough. Add a little of the soaking water if needed<br><br>

- Transfer dough to the pan and flatten into a square. Pack it down, and make sure it's even thickness<br><br>

- Chill in the fridge for a few hours before slicing<br><br>
