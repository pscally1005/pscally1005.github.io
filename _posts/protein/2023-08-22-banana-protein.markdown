Description: If you want to have <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#banana-bread">banana bread</a> for breakfast or a dessert, this recipe works as a great way to satisfy that craving while still hitting your protein needs. This healthy cake has some healthy fats in chia seeds and peanut butter, and is free of added sugars and artificial sweeteners.  Some similar recipes are my <a href="apple-bread">Protein Apple Bread</a> or <a href="pumpkin-bread">Protein Pumpkin Loaf</a>, which you should totally try
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a bread pan with parchment paper. Lightly spray the parchment paper with oil<br><br>

- I've used 1 tsp (5 g) of liquid monk fruit here as my sweetener, but other good options are 1 tsp (5 g) liquid stevia, 2 tbsp (42 g) honey, or 2 tbsp (40 g) maple syrup<br><br>

- Combine all ingredients together in a food processor until you have a smooth, liquid batter. Add in the baking soda and baking powder last, once the batter has already formed, in order to make sure the cake rises properly.  Transfer the batter to your pan<br><br>

- You can also combine ingredients together in a bowl.  Just mash the bananas with a fork or potato masher, and mix with the wet ingredients.  Add the dry ingredients on top, and mix.  Mix in the leaveners (baking powder and baking soda), and transfer the batter to the pan<br><br>

- Optionally top with some blueberries, chocolate chips, or nuts (or can fold into the batter)<br><br>

- Bake for 1 hour at 350F. The cake should be about 205F, and a toothpick to the center will come out clean<br><br>

- Let cool on a wire rack, then transfer to a fridge in a bag or container<br><br>

- You can also bake in a parchment lined, lightly oiled, 8" square baking pan as well, and slice into 16 square bars.  Bake for 45 minutes (uncovered) at 325F, or until the internal temperature is around 205F<br><br>
