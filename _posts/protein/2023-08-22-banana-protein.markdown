Description: If you want to have banana bread for breakfast or a dessert, this recipe works as a great way to satisfy that craving while still hitting your protein needs. This healthy cake has some healthy fats in chia seeds and peanut butter, and is free of added sugars and artificial sweeteners.  Some similar recipes are my <a href="apple-bread">Protein Apple Bread</a> or <a href="pumpkin-bread">Protein Pumpkin Loaf</a>, which you should totally try
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F and line a bread pan with parchment paper. Spray with oil spray as well<br><br>

- Combine all ingredients together in a food processor until you have a smooth, liquid batter. Add in the baking soda and baking powder last, once the liquid has already formed, in order to make sure the cake rises properly<br><br>

- Pour your batter into the pan. Optionally top with some blueberries, chocolate chips, or nuts (or can fold into the batter)<br><br>

- Bake for 1 hour at 350F. The cake should be about 200F, and a toothpick to the center will come out clean<br><br>

- Let cool on a wire rack, then transfer to a fridge in a bag or container
