Description: This cinnamon apple bread is a perfect fall based dessert that won't set you off your healthy eating path. It's similar to my <a href="banana-protein">Protein Banana Nut Bread</a> and <a href="pumpkin-bread">Protein Pumpkin Loaf</a> recipes, but apple based instead (duh).  The combination of cinnamon and ginger with apples is a classic for a reason! This recipe also works fantastic as a carrot cake recipe too, just swap out the apples for grated carrots, or check out my <a href="carrot-cake">Layered Protein Carrot Cake</a>.
Instructions: 
- Combine dry ingredients in a bowl - oat flour, whey, casein, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, and ginger<br><br>

- Chop the apple and add to a food processor with the cottage cheese. Blend the apple as much as possible, then add the eggs, vanilla, and stevia. Blend until foamy and no apple chunks remain<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and fold together until just combined<br><br>

- Transfer everything to a bread pan and bake for 30 min at 350Â°F. Cake is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 200F<br><br>

- Let the cake cool down, then slice and refrigerate for 3-4 days.  You can serve with some whipped cottage cheese on top per slice
