Description: Protein ice cream sandwiches are one of my favorite desserts to make. They are 2 no bake protein oat cookies, with a layer of banana ice cream in the middle. The ice cream is very versatile, so you can mix up the flavor by using other frozen fruits or extracts.
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mash your bananas with a fork. Mix in the rest of the cookie ingredients - peanut butter, vanilla, almond extract, liquid stevia, cinnamon, salt, cocoa, whey, casein, and quick oats. Chill in the fridge for the oats to soak up the liquid, about 15 minutes<br><br>

- Shape dough into balls (about 24 cookies, 28 g each), and place on a parchment lined cookie sheet.<br><br>

- Slightly wet your fingers, and flatten each cookie as thin as possible. It's okay if they touch a little bit, since they won't be baking. Freeze to fully harden, about 2 hours<br><br>

- In a food processor, combine the ice cream ingredients - frozen bananas, frozen fruit (mangos or berries work well), and PB2. Process until you have an ice cream like texture.<br><br>

- Take 2 cookies and a scoop of ice cream (about 50 g). Make into a sandwich, and wrap in aluminum foil. Store ice cream sandwiches in the freezer. Makes 12 sandwiches. Work quickly, the cookies thaw fast since they're so thin. Put the cookies back in freezer if needed
