Description: These caramel candy bars are a healthy take on a Twix bar. They feature a protein based shortbread, and banana dessert hummus filling (based off my <a href="banana-bread-hummus">Banana Bread Hummus Spread</a>), and are topped with melted chocolate. To me, these taste way better than an actual candy bar, and they're not just empty calories.
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, mix together the base layer ingredients (applesauce, almond milk, honey, vanilla, almond extract, salt, and casein. Line an 8" baking pan with parchment, and press the dough into it. Freeze to harden<br><br>

- Combine the filling ingredients (chickpeas, almond butter, banana, whey, almond extract, salt, and liquid stevia/monk fruit) together in a food processor. Make sure to drain and rinse the can of chickpeas. If you're using a standard 15.5 oz can, you should have about 125g of chickpeas in the food processor, after the liquid is drained (since you're only using half the can)<br><br>

- Blend until smooth, and spread on top of the base layer. Again, freeze to harden<br><br>

- In a small bowl, melt the coconut oil. Stir in the rest of the chocolate ingredients (cocoa, honey, liquid stevia/monk fruit, almond extract, and salt). Spread on top of the filling. Chill to harden<br><br>
