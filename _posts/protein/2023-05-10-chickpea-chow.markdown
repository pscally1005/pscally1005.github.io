Description: These "Chickpea Chows" as I call them are a no bake healthy cookie dough recipe. They evolved out of my <a href="banana-bread-hummus">Banana Bread Hummus Spread</a> recipe, where I continued to add solids until I had a workable dough. They're naturally sweetened, filling, and a fun way to add more nutrients to your diet.  For another edible cookie dough, see my <a href="protein-cookie-dough">Edible Protein Cookie Dough</a>, or for another bean based dessert, you should make my <a href="chickpea-brownies">Chickpea Protein Brownies</a>
Instructions: 
- In the following order, blend all ingredients together in a food processor - 15.5 oz can chickpeas (drained and rinsed), peanut butter, frozen bananas, liquid sweetener, almond extract, cinnamon, salt, PB2, whey, casein, and oat flour<br><br>

- A slightly sticky cookie dough will have formed. Optionally, fold in some chopped chocolate (1/4 cup, 60 g). Freeze the food processor for about 15 minutes to harden the dough.<br><br>

- Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Roll the dough into balls, and place on the sheet. Lightly wetting your hands helps to roll the dough without sticking. Refrigerate or freeze to harden the dough balls, then transfer to a Ziploc bag. Store in the fridge or freezer.
