Description: Eggs are like nature's multivitamin. They're a rich source of selenium, vitamins B5 and B12, phosphorus, antioxidants, choline, and more. They're cheap and easy to prepare, and of course a complete protein. The problem is that 1 egg only has about 6 g of protein to 5 g of fat. The fat in the egg yolks is essential (the yolk is where all the nutrients come from), whereas the egg white is basically just protein. So combining the 2 (whole eggs and liquid egg whites) is a great way to up the protein content, while still keeping the healthful fats and various nutrients you need. Combine that with vegetables, and you have a delicious and filling meal with fiber, more vitamins and minerals, and complex carbs as well!
Instructions: 
- Preheat a medium nonstick pan over medium heat with a spray of olive oil. Cut your pepper into a medium dice, and add to the pan with lemon pepper. Mix, cover, and cook until softened and lightly charred (about 5 minutes)<br><br>

- Dump in your tomatoes and add the spices (chili powder, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder). Mix, cover, and let simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat<br><br>

- In a medium glass, crack your eggs and beat with a fork. Pour in the egg whites, and mix to combine<br><br>

- Dump the eggs into the pan, fully incorporate with the vegetables, and return the pan to the heat. Cook for just 1-2 minutes with frequent stirring, or until the eggs have reached a soft scramble<br><br>

- Top with hot sauce and everything bagel seasoning (optional) and serve
