Description: Blueberry muffins are a classic quick grab and go breakfast for a reason, but they're traditionally loaded with added sugars. These ones however are much healthier than the classic though, packing fiber with oat flour, and avoiding tons of added sugars and unhealthy fats.
Instructions: 
- To a large bowl, mash the bananas. Add in the other wet ingredients (maple syrup, applesauce, yogurt, and egg)<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (oat flour, cornstarch, PB2, and baking soda)<br><br>

- Add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix until just combined. Fold in the blueberries<br><br>

- Grease a muffin pan with spray and spoon in the batter<br><br>

- Bake for ~24 minutes at 350F (muffins should be about 205F and toothpick will come out clean).<br><br>

- Optionally, brush tops of muffins with 1 tbsp melted butter. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes then transfer to a wire rack or plate to cool<br><br>
