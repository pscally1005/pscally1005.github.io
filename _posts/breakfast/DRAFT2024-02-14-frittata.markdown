Description: Crepes are a fun Sunday morning breakfast for the family, and this recipe is a great whole wheat crepe batter that can be topped with anything, sweet or savory. The nutrition facts just for the crepes themselves, not any filling
Instructions: 
- To a large bowl, beat the egg. Add in the yogurt, honey/maple syrup, salt, vanilla and fully combine. Mix in the milk, then mix in the flour well.<br><br>

- Refrigerate at least 30-60 minutes, but preferably overnight<br><br>

- Spray an 8” pan with cooking spray between each one and set the burner to medium heat. Using a ¼ cup, fill about halfway and pour into the pan. Immediately swirl the lan around to thin out the crepe and make as wide as the pan<br><br>

- Cook for about a minute on each side, or until opposite side starts to get some color<br><br>

- Serve each one with some filling. Makes about 10 small crepes<br><br>

- Stack leftovers aside on a plate or wire rack to cool<br>
