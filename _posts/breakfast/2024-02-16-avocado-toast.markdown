Description: Avocados were on sale at my grocery store, so now I'm officially a hipster. This avocado toast is simple, healthy, and can be topped with different vegetables such as tomatoes or roasted peppers to make it even better. It comes together in the time it takes to toast the bread, and will leave you full and feeling great.  This goes great on a slice of my <a href="ww-bread">100% Whole Wheat Bread</a>
Instructions: 
- In a toaster or air fryer, toast your bread to your liking<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, mash your avocado until decently smooth (a little bit of chunks is okay). Pour in lemon, season, and mix<br><br>

- Spread the avocado on your toast, and optionally add some toppings. Good ideas are tomatoes, scrambled eggs, pickled onions, or roasted peppers. Be creative with it!
