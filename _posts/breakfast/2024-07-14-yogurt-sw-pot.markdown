Description: This has been my breakfast for the past 4 mornings, and I'm prepared to have it another 4 times because it's great. This bowl is a great source of protein, healthy fats, complex carbs, fiber, calcium, potassium, vitamin B12, and vitamin A. It's delicious, filling, and super quick to make
Instructions: 
- Here I'm using <a href="/recipes/sweet-potato-puree">sweet potato puree</a>, that I made by roasting and blending a whole sweet potato (with the skin) until smooth. Some other substitutes would be canned pumpkin or sweet potato puree, applesauce, mashed banana, or <a href="/recipes/apple-spread">apple spread</a><br><br>

- Some other ingredient swaps would be:<br>- Use cottage cheese instead of yogurt<br>- Using a different <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">natural nut butter</a> instead of almond<br>- Replacing the strawberries with any other berries, like blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries<br>- You can also add 2 tbsp of chia seeds (25 g) or ground flax seeds (13 g) for additional fiber, fat, and Omega-3s<br><br>

- Mix all ingredients (except the strawberries) together in a small bowl. Finely dice your strawberries, add on top, and serve
