Description: I've been needing to make bigger meals lately. My problem is I tend to take too little food, and then up always eating something else immediately following the meal. This oatmeal is my way of solving this problem by making a substantial enough bowl to keep me full until lunch without going over the top. It's packed with protein (powder and yogurt), healthy fats (chia seeds), fiber (oats and chia), and a good source of carbs (banana and oats) in the morning to start your day off right
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, mash your banana with the back of a fork until smooth. Combine with the rest of the ingredients (except the strawberries), and mix until creamy and fully combined. Add more water as needed if you need to thin it out<br><br>

- Cover with a plate, and microwave on high for 2 minutes, stirring halfway. Top with sliced strawberries, and enjoy
