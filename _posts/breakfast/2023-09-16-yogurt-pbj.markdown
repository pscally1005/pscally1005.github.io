Description: Here I've made 4 different variations of yogurt bowls that you can easily prep the night before for an easy breakfast. We have PB&J, Apple Pie, Chocolate, and Peanut Butter Banana for you to enjoy
Instructions: 
- In a small bowl or airtight container, mix together the base ingredients (yogurt, milk, applesauce, whey, peanut butter, cinnamon, and optional sweetener). Choose a flavor below, and mix in. Top with your fruit and chopped nuts (if you didn't use peanut butter)<br><br>
