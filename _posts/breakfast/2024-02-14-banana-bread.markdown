Description: Unlike traditional banana bread or muffins, this recipe is healthy enough to be eaten for breakfast, as it's not loaded with added sugars or unhealthy fats. The base recipe is great on its own, but elevated even more if you mix in some chocolate chips and top with some melted peanut butter. Bonus points for being gluten free too!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F and line a bread pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients - oat flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt<br><br>

- In a separate medium bowl, mash the banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients - maple strup, applesauce, yogurt, and egg<br><br>

- Pour the wet into the dry and mix just until smooth. Optionally fold in some chocolate chips, about 4 tbsp (60 g)<br>

- Pour batter into the pan and smooth the top.<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for an hour. Cover with foil for the last 15 minutes<br><br>

- Let rest in the pan for 10 minutes.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool<br><br>
