Description: Blueberry <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#muffins">muffins</a> are a classic quick grab and go breakfast for a reason, but they're traditionally loaded with added sugars and oils. These ones however are much healthier than the classic though, packing fiber with oat flour, and avoiding tons of added sugars and unhealthy fats.  Check out my <a href="banana-bread">Oatmeal Banana Mini Muffins</a> and my <a href="double-chocolate-banana-bread">Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a> for similar recipes
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients - quick oats, cornstarch, powdered peanut butter, and baking soda<br><br>

- In a separate medium bowl, mash the banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients - yogurt, <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">nut butter</a>, applesauce, egg, and maple syrup (or honey)<br><br>

- Any kind of nut butter, like peanut or almond, will work.  For a nut free version, use pumpkin seed or sunflower seed butter.  Note that sunflower seed butter may turn the muffins green due to the reaction between the chlorophyll in the sunflower butter and the baking soda.  It's perfectly safe to eat and doesn't alter the taste, just a cosmetic change<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix until just combined with a silicone spatula. Fold in the blueberries<br><br>

- Liberally grease a muffin pan with spray, and evenly spoon in the batter.  This recipe makes a dozen standard size muffins<br><br>

- Bake for about 22 minutes (uncovered) at 350F, until the muffins have an internal temperature of about 200F and toothpick comes out clean.  You can also bake these as mini muffins (makes 40) for about 12 minutes at 350F (uncovered)<br><br>

- Alternatively, you can bake this as a banana bread in a loaf pan for about an hour (covered), until a toothpick is almost clean and the internal temperature is around 190F<br><br>

- Optionally, brush tops of muffins with 1 tbsp (14 g) melted unsalted butter. Let cool totally in the pan before removing from the pan with a butter knife
