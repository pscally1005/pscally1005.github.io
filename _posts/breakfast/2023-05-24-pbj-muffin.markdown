Description: Blueberry muffins are a classic quick grab and go breakfast for a reason, but they're traditionally loaded with added sugars. These ones however are much healthier than the classic though, packing fiber with oat flour, and avoiding tons of added sugars and unhealthy fats.  Check out my <a href="banana-bread">Breakfast Banana Bread</a> and my <a href="double-chocolate-banana-bread">Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a> for similar recipes
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients (quick oats, cornstarch, powdered peanut butter, and baking soda)<br><br>

- In a separate medium bowl, mash the banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients - yogurt, <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">nut butter</a>, applesauce, egg, and maple syrup (or honey).  Any kind of nut butter, like peanut or almond, will work.  For a nut free version, use sunflower seed butter<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients to the dry, and mix until just combined with a silicone spatula. Fold in the blueberries<br><br>

- Grease a muffin pan with spray and spoon in the batter<br><br>

- Bake for about 22-24 minutes (uncovered) at 350F, until the muffins have an internal temperature of about 190F and toothpick comes out almost clean<br><br>

- Optionally, brush tops of muffins with 1 tbsp (14 g) melted unsalted butter. Let cool totally in the pan before removing from the pan with a butter knife
