Description: These egg muffins are a great way to prep some breakfast ahead of time and eat on the go. Saute whatever vegetables you like (I went with spinach, pepper, and onion), mix with eggs, and bake. Each serving is 1 egg's worth; 6 mini muffins or 3 regular sized muffins
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and heat a large pan over medium heat. Cut your peppers and onions into a small dice. Add vegetables to the pan with oil and salt. Cover, and cook until peppers have softened and onions turn translucent<br><br>

- Season to taste with whatever you like. I went with paprika, chili powder, lemon pepper, garlic, onion, black pepper, and hot sauce<br><br>

- Crack your eggs into a large bowl, and mix with the vegetables. Liberally grease a muffin tin, and evenly divide your batter. This recipe makes 24 mini muffins or 12 regular sized muffins<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 15 minutes for mini muffins, or about 20 minutes for regular sized muffins. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack and serving. Optionally, top with shredded cheese and serve with salsa<br><br>
