Description: I love having eggs for breakfast, but I don't like spending 15 minutes making breakfast for just 1 morning, just to do it again the next day. This recipe serves as a way to prep a whole week's worth of breakfast to store in the freezer for easy reheating in the morning. Wrap these in protein tortillas as I did here for even more of a nutrient boost
Instructions: 
- Dice the onion small, and add the onion and defrosted spinach to a 12‚Äù pan over medium heat (3-4 on my stove) with a spray of oil<br><br>

- Add in the hot sauce, garlic, and spices. Cover and cook until onions are translucent (medium heat)<br><br>

- Remove the pan from the burner, and crack in the 6 eggs. Beat the eggs with your spatula until fully beaten and everything is fully mixed<br><br>

- Return to the burner and cook until eggs are almost done (~15 min?) over medium heat<br><br>

- When eggs are almost done, add in the cheese and salsa and stir until incorporated<br>

- Divide the mix evenly across 6 tortillas. Wait to shape the leftovers until the eggs have cooled. Optionally top with some sauce<br><br>

- Wrap up, wrap in aluminum foil, and freeze<br><br>

- To reheat, wrap burrito in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 2 minutes. Then grill (panini press) on all 4 sides for a few minutes or until the tortilla is lightly golden brown
