Description: I've challenged myself to go the month of February without any nut butter (should've chosen November). I've used avocados as my fat source here, as they're highly nutritious and add creaminess and bulk. I've also topped it with blueberries, so I guess I'm taking some inspiration from Genius Foods
Instructions: 
- In a bowl, mash your avocado with the back of a fork. Mix in the rest of the ingredients, divide across 2 bowls, and top with blueberries
