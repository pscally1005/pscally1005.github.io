Description: Vic got me a pair of PopTart socks, so now I'm legally obligated to make a healthy version myself (those are the rules). It's a gluten free crust made of coconut flour, oat flour, and whey, with a homemade <a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> filling, giving you a toaster pastry you can actually eat for breakfast. I also drizzled some melted peanut butter on top for healthy fats and some more protein.  You can do everything the night before, and just toast/airfry the PopTart in the morning, making for a quick and easy breakfast with over 45 g of protein!
Instructions: 
- In a bowl, combine together the crust ingredients (whey, syrup, cinnamon, salt, almond extract, yogurt, coconut flour, and oat flour).  You should have a slightly sticky dough.  Refrigerate for about 30 minutes for the oats to absorb the liquid<br><br>

- Place the dough onto a piece of parchment paper, and lightly wet your hands.  Flatten to an even thin rectangle, and scoop a little bit of batter onto half of it, spreading evenly<br><br>

- I've used <a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> for these PopTarts, but unsweetened applesauce would also work.  Any low or no sugar jelly or jam (such as <a href="berry-jam">Low Sugar Berry Jam</a>) would also work well as a filling, as well as date paste<br><br>

- Fold the PopTart over on itself.  Crimp all the edges together with a fork.  Poke the top a few times with a fork<br><br>

- Air fry at 350F for about 6 minutes, or until the PopTart is a golden brown color<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a small bowl, melt peanut butter in the microwave.  Drizzle on top of the PopTart, and serve
