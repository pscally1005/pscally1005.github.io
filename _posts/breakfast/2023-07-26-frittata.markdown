Description: Along with my meal prep egg wraps, this is my other way of making multiple days worth of eggs at once. These are made in a very similar way, with a hidden ingredient to add some more protein. Customize this with any vegetables or spices that you desire.
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 375F and dice the onion small, and add the onion and defrosted spinach to a 10‚Äù cast iron pan over medium high heat with a spray of oil<br><br>

- Add in the hot sauce, garlic, and spices<br><br>

- Cook the vegetable mix for a few minutes, until the onions soften slightly<br><br>

- Meanwhile, crack the eggs in a large bowl and beat with a whisk. When fully beaten, add in the cottage cheese and mix until fully combined<br><br>

- When vegetable mix has reduced and onions are starting to go translucent, remove from the heat and add the salsa. Pour in the egg mixture, and mix with a spatula until the eggs and spinach are fully combined. This will take a few minutes of gentle mixing<br><br>

- Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes., until the center is set and golden around the edges (at least 160F). Let rest for 15 minutes before slicing<br><br>

- Let cool on a cookie sheet. Can flash freeze<br>
