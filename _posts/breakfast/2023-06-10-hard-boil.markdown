Description: Hard boiled eggs are a quick snack or breakfast, and they are also a quick protein source. Great when chopped up on a salad, these boiled eggs can be made either on the stove, or in the air fryer (my preferred way)
Instructions: 
- Place eggs in a large pot and cover with water, about an inch over the top of the eggs. Bring to a boil, and let boil for 2 minutes. Reduce heat a simmer, and simmer for 12 minutes, uncovered<br><br>

- You could also air fry the eggs at 250F for 15 minutes<br><br>

- When done, drain water and run with cold water and ice cubes
