Description: These delicious banana muffins are free of any oils, added sugars, and artificial sweeteners. Just 4 simple ingredients - bananas, sweet potatoes, eggs, and nut butter. These are muffins that are actually a breakfast and not a dessert, and can have any mix-ins you like, such as chopped nuts, fruit, or even dark chocolate.  The nutrition facts below are assuming just the 4 base ingredients; no mix-ins
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 375F and liberally spray a mini muffin tin with oil<br><br>

- In a large bowl, add your cooked sweet potato (without skin) and your ripe banana. Mash with the back of a fork, or mix with a hand mixer. You can also use a food processor<br><br>

- Canned sweet potato or pumpkin puree will work, but I prefer to use my homemade <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a>.  I've never tried with <a href="roasted-butternut-squash-puree">Roasted Butternut Squash Puree</a>, but I don't see why that wouldn't be great as well<br><br>

- You can also use unsweetened applesauce or <a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> in place of mashed bananas<br><br>

- Add in the eggs and nut butter, and mix until fully combined<br><br>

- Any nut or seed butter will work; here I've used some <a href="natural-peanut-butter">Homemade Natural Nut Butter</a> using a combination of peanuts and pistachios, but almond butter or sunflower seed butter would also work great<br><br>

- Finally, to make it vegan, you can replace the eggs with flax or chia eggs, where 1 tbsp of flax or chia seeds + 3 tbsp water is equivalent to 1 egg.  Mix together in a small bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to thicken before adding to the muffin batter<br><br>

- Add in any additional ingredients if desired. I'll go with cinnamon and almond extract. I'm also going to top them with a few mini chocolate chips<br><br>

- Transfer your batter to the muffin pan, and bake for about 16 minutes at 375F, or until a toothpick comes out clean.  Let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes, before transferring to a wire rack to cool.  Store in the fridge<br><br>
