Description: Unlike traditional banana bread or muffins, this recipe is healthy enough to be eaten for breakfast, as it's not loaded with added sugars or unhealthy fats. The base recipe is great on its own, but elevated even more if you mix in some chocolate chips and top with some melted peanut butter (not included in the nutrition facts). Bonus points for being gluten free too!

Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients - quick oats, oat flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt<br><br>

- In a separate medium bowl, mash the banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients - yogurt, <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">nut butter</a>, applesauce, egg, and maple syrup (or honey).  Any kind of nut butter, like peanut or almond, will work.  For a nut free version, use sunflower seed butter<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix just until smooth with a silicone spatula. Optionally fold in some chocolate chips<br><br>

- Liberally grease a mini muffin pan with oil.  Evenly spoon the batter into the muffin holes.  This recipe makes 40 mini muffins; I had to bake in 2 batches<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 12 minutes (uncovered), or until a toothpick comes out clean, and the internal temperature is around 200F.  You can also bake these as standard size muffins (makes 12) for about 22 minutes at 350F (uncovered)<br><br>

- Alternatively, you can bake this as a banana bread in a loaf pan for about an hour (covered), until a toothpick is almost clean and the internal temperature is around 190F<br><br>
