Description: An overnight oats recipe I developed for my girlfriend, which I made a little sweeter than my standard overnight oats, but still with a good dose of fiber, protein, and healthy fats to start your morning off right
Instructions: 
- Add ingredients to a mason jar or Tupperware. Optionally top with mini chocolate chips. Store in the fridge overnight
