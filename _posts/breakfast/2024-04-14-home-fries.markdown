Description: Home fries are a great breakfast side with eggs consisting of potatoes and sometimes peppers and onions. I almost always use sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes, as they have much more flavor and nutrients. Try whipping this up alongside my <a href="frittata">Spinach and Onion Frittata</a>, <a href="scrambled-eggs">Long Weekend Scrambled Eggs</a>, or <a href="egg-muffins">Mini Egg Muffins</a>, or serve as a side with dinner
Instructions: 
- Wash and dice your sweet potatoes into bite sized cubes. Don't peel the potatoes. Season with oil, paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper<br><br>

- Air fry the potatoes for 30 minutes at 400F, mixing halfway<br><br>

- Meanwhile, cut your onion and pepper into a small dice. Add to a bowl and season with soy sauce, oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, chili powder, black pepper, and salt<br><br>

- Heat a large pan over medium heat and add in your peppers and onions. Cover and cook under occasional stirring until the onions are translucent and the peppers are soft<br><br>

- When the potatoes are finished, combine them in the pan with the vegetables. Top with dried parsley, and serve with eggs<br><br>
