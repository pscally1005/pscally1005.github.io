Description: I love protein overnight oats for breakfast, but not everyone has protein powder. These oats are essentially just <a href="vic-oats">Very Vic</a>, but with Greek yogurt instead of protein powder.  And yet it still provides over 35 g of protein in a bowl for a healthy, filling, and simple breakfast. If you don't like the taste of yogurt, then you will not like this breakfast. You have been warned.  For a yogurt free overnight oats, check out my <a href="no-yogurt-oatmeal">Yogurt Free Protein Oats</a>
Instructions: 
- Mix all ingredients together in a bowl or airtight container. Refrigerate overnight, and enjoy cold or warm
