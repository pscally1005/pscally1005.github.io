Description: When recipes call for <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#chocolate">dark chocolate</a> or chocolate chips, I typically make some variation of this recipe. Sure, you could just melt an unsweetened bar of chocolate with your desired sweetener, but this is just as much effort and cheaper too. Mix in some chopped nuts too if you want to spice it up!
Instructions: 
- Prepare a bread pan or tupperware with parchment paper. Set aide<br><br>

- In a glass bowl, add the coconut oil and microwave for about 1 minute, until fully melted<br><br>

- You can either sweeten your chocolat bar, or choose to leave it unsweetened.  I prefer the latter, but if you want it sweeter, I'd recommend either 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) liquid monk fruit or stevia, or 1 tbsp (20 g) honey or maple syrup<br><br>

- Add cocoa powder, salt, vanilla, and (optional) sweetener. Stir until smooth<br><br>

- Pour into pan. Top with any mix ins (such as chopped nuts, 1/4 cup, 30 g) if desired. Chill in the fridge for about an hour.  Cut and store in the fridge<br><br>

- This chopped up bar of chocolate works great as a replacement for chocolate chips in all recipes, such as <a href="date-brownie">Gluten Free Date Brownies</a>, <a href="syrup-cookies">Sugar Free Syrup Cookies</a>, or my <a href="double-chocolate-banana-bread">Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a>
