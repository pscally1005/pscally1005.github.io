Description: Coconut macaroons are such a simple healthy dessert, and are great for all you coconut lovers out there. I personally don't like coconut, but even I admit these are hay in the needle stack. To use up those extra yolks though, check out my <a href="hollandaise">Greek Yogurt Hollandaise Sauce</a>
Instructions: 
- Beat together egg whites until soft peaks in a glass bowl<br><br>

- Fold in honey, vanilla, almond extract, and salt. Mix in coconut and oats until fully combined and sticky<br><br>

- Scoop cookies onto a lined baking sheet. Shape with your fingers if falling apart. Chill in fridge for 30 minutes<br><br>

- Bake at 325F for 15 minutes. Cookies will be lightly browned in the top and golden/dark on the bottom. Transfer to a wire rack to cool<br><br>

- Optionally drizzle with melted chocolate (2 tbsp, 25 g), or dip the bottoms in chocolate
