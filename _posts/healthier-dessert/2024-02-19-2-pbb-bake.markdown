Description: Remember how I mentioned that most healthy recipes are a combo of banana, peanut butter, chocolate, and oats? Well this is my baked version of that formula. 
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F. Line a 9x5 loaf pan or 8x8 baking pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- Mash the ripe bananas with a fork (or blend them and add them to the bowl). Mix in the peanut butter, oats, salt, and vanilla until combined. Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Pour mixture into the pan, using a spoon to smooth it out.  Bake for 25-30 minutes in the loaf pan<br><br>

- Or bake as mini muffins, 15 minutes at 350F. Makes 24<br><br>

- Take out of the pan and place on a cooling rack for 1 hour. Cut into 10 and store in tupperware in the fridge (3-5 days), or put extras in the freezer
