Description: These cookies are similar to my granulated monk fruit cookies, as they're customizable and sugar free. Instead of a granular sweetener though, these use a liquid zero calorie sweetener, so that way you can make them with whatever sweet device you have on hand. Feel free to mix up the flours (whole wheat, almond oat flour, etc.) or the mix-ins (chocolate chips, chopped nuts, raisins, etc.)
Instructions: 
- In a bowl, mix together the base ingredients - sugar free syrup (or any other liquid sweetener), unsweetened applesauce, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt<br><br>

- Here are some example flavors that you can make<br>
- <b>Chocolate Chip</b> - whole wheat flour (1 cup, 124 g), and chopped sugar free chocolate (1/4 cup, 45 g)<br>
- <b>Oatmeal Raisin</b> - cinnamon (1/2 tsp), oat flour (1.33 cup, 120 g), and raisins (1/4 cup, 40 g)<br>
- <b>Peanut Chocolate</b> - PB2 (1 cup, 100 g, omit the salt if using PB2), and chopped sugar free chocolate (1/4 cup, 45 g)<br>
- <b>Almond</b> - almond extract (1/2 tsp, 2.5 g), and almond flour (1 cup, 112 g)<br>
- <b>Coconut</b> - blended unsweetened coconut flakes (1 cup, 100 g), and a drizzle of melted chocolate on the baked cookies at the end<br><br>

- Choose your flavor. Here, the flour is a mix of PB2 and oat flour, with some dark chocolate chips folded in. Let the dough chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to an hour to harden<br><br>

- Line a cookie sheet with parchment and preheat your oven to 350F. Scoop dough onto the sheet, and flatten into a cookie (they won't flatten or spread as they bake)<br><br>
