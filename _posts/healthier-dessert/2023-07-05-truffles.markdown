Description: These healthy truffles are my variation of a healthy Oreo ball. They taste amazing right out of the freezer, and don't even need to be coated in chocolate if you want to save even more calories. They're even better when made with dutch process cocoa instead of natural cocoa, giving it more of that classic Oreo taste.
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, mix together the truffle ingredients (peanut butter, honey, applesauce, whipped cottage cheese, vanilla, salt, cocoa, PB2, and oat flour). Mix in the oat flour a little at a time, pressing the spoon into the dough to get it fully combined<br><br>

- Roll the dough into balls. Place on a plate, and freeze to harden the balls, about 10 minutes<br><br>

- Melt the coconnut oil in the microwave, and mix with the rest of the chocolate ingredients (vanilla, cocoa, honey, salt, and almond extract). Dip the truffles in the chocolate, and return to the plate. Chill to harden. Store in the fridge or freezer
