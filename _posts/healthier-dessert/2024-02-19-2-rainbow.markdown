Description: I love rainbow cookies, so making a healthier version was something I was excited to tackle. Seeing the 3 sticks of butter in the original recipe was enough to make me cautious eating them, just like anyone who has made cheesecake could tell you about the amount of creme cheese in there. I've decided to swap the sugar, flour, and butter for monk fruit, oat flour, and applesauce, as well as opt for a homemade sugar free jam.
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F, and line 3 8x8 sheets with parchment paper. Spray the paper as well

- In a food processor or blender, blend together all the cookie ingredients (almond butter, granulated monk fruit, applesauce, yogurt, almond milk, egg yolks, almond extract, baking powder, salt, and oats) except the egg whites. Do include the yolks though. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.  Optionally, you can add in 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of butter extract or cake batter extract<br><br>

- In a medium glass or metal bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until you have stiff peaks. Fold the egg whites into the cookie batter<br><br>

- Prepare 2 other large bowls for dying the batter. Evenly spread the batter across your 3 bowls. Dye one red, one green, and the final one yellow<br><br>

- Transfer the batters into separate pans. Bake at 350F for 8 minutes. Remove from the pan, and let cool completely on a wire rack. I only have 1 8" pan, so I'll be doing it in 3 batches<br><br>

- Once totally cooled, spread half your jam on top of the green layer. Place the yellow layer on top of the green layer, and spread the other half of the jam on top of the yellow layer. Place the red layer on top<br><br>

- Wrap the entire cake in plastic wrap. Place on a cookie sheet, and place a weight on top of it. I used another baking pan with my 10lb ankle weights on top of them. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight<br><br>

- The next day, remove the plastic, and flip the cake onto a cutting board or wire rack<br><br>

- Make just half of the chocolate (half the amounds of melted coconut oil, cocoa powder, liquid stevia, and salt), and spread onto the top layer of the cake. Chill in the refrigerator until the chocolate is firm, at least 30 minutes<br><br>

- Flip the cake and repeat with the other half of the chocolate on the other side. Again, chill to harden the chocolate, at least 30 minutes<br><br>

- Once cooled, cut the cake into about 1 inch squares.  Flash freeze before storing in a container in the freezer<br><br>
