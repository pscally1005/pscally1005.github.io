Description: These simple and healthy brownie bites are made with just 2 ingredients - pureed bananas and cocoa powder. These taste like delicious chocolate banana bread, but dense and fudgy, as all brownies should be. Feel free to add any extra flavors such as vanilla or cinnamon, or any mix-ins like chocolate chips or chopped nuts. The nutrition facts are per brownie bite, but 4 is equivalent to 1 banana
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and spray a mini muffin pan with oil<br><br>

- Choose bananas that are as brown and soft as possible for the sweetest brownies. You can also use <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> instead of bananas (the batch here is actually a mix of both!). Using a food processor, blend the banana until smooth. Transfer to a mixing bowl. You can also mash the bananas with the back of a fork in a bowl, but it won't be as smooth<br><br>

- Add the cocoa powder, and stir to fully combine to get rid of the cocoa clumps. Using PB2 in place of cocoa powder would probably work to make it a blondie instead and add more protein, but I haven't personally tried it yet<br><br>

- Optionally, mix in some other flavors. You can use extracts (vanilla or almond), spices (cinnamon and salt), or mix-ins (chocolate chips, nuts, raisins). For a cakier brownie, add a pinch of baking powder<br><br>

- Evenly divide your batter across 24 mini muffin cups. They won't rise as they bake, so fill them completely. Any extra batter is a snack to the chef, or just bake a few extra. Alternatively, you can bake as regular brownies in a parchment lined 8" square pan<br><br>

- Bake the brownie bites at 350F for about 14 minutes, or until the tops look black and the top is just firm. A toothpick to the center should NOT come out clean. For an 8" pan, bake for 30 minutes. If you jiggle the pan, the center should just be set<br><br>

- Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight) so the brownies can set before removing from the pan and slicing
