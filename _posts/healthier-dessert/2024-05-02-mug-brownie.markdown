Description: These mug brownies are perfect for when you want just 1 dessert instead of a whole pan. They're ultra gooey dark chocolate brownies without any added sugar, and contain less than 200 calories per mug. It takes only 5 minutes to make, and only dirties a mug and a spoon.  If you like mug desserts, check out my <a href="protein-mug-cake">Protein Mug Cake</a>
Instructions: 
- In a mug, mix together the oat flour and cocoa powder until fully combined. Add in the applesauce, milk, and syrup. Mix fully to form a thick batter<br><br>

- Finely chop a square of unsweetened chocolate. Fold some into the batter, and top with the rest. Optionally top with flakey salt (or fold fine salt into the batter)<br><br>

- Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes, or until just set on the top, but still gooey inside. Let cool for 2 minutes before eating<br><br>
