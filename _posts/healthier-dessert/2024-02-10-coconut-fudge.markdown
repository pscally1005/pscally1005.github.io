Description: The past week I've been obsessed with developing a healthy fudge recipe for some reason, and this is my result. It's nut free, being made with homemade coconut butter (or you could use almond or peanut butter if you like). It's mildly sweetened with maple syrup and either banana or sweet potato, but still rich, delicious, and healthy. It has a dense fudge texture and taste, without making you feel gross after eating like the traditional candy.  For a high protein fudge, check out the <a href="avocado-fudge">Unsweetened Avocado Fudge - Nut and Lactose Free</a>
Instructions: 
- Add your coconut flakes to a food processor, and blend on high speed to form your coconut butter, scraping down the sides every minute or so. This could take about 5 minutes, depending on your food processor. Be patient if it doesn't look like it's working right away<br><br>

- You can either use an overripe banana, or bake a sweet potato, scrape out the insides, and use sweet potato mash instead. Add your sweetener to taste. I called for 2 tbsp, but you might prefer it with double. I honestly like it better with none, so see how you like it<br><br>

- Once you have a smooth coconut butter (it should be the similar to the consistency of a natural nut butter), blend in the rest of the ingredients until smooth.<br><br>

- Line an 8" square baking pan with parchment paper (or a bread pan for a half batch). Press mixture evenly into the pan, and optionally top with flakey salt or chopped nuts. Refrigerate for a few fours to harden before slicing into small squares
