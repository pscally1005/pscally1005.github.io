Description: These brownies are so good that you would never know there were beans in there. The combination of beans, oats, and dates means they're packed with fiber. They contain only healthy fats from the nuts, and are free of any refined sugars. These brownies are super rich, fudgey, the right amount of sweet, gluten free and vegan, and only 100 calories. Use sunflower or pumpkin seed butter to make them nut free too.

Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, line a 9x13" baking pan with parchment paper, and lightly spray it with oil. Drain and rinse your beans<br><br>

- If you don't already have oat flour, you can just blend up quick or rolled oats in your food processor. Make sure to grind up the oats on their own, as they won't get fully blended if you do it with everything else<br><br>

- Place the rest of the ingredients and blend until a smooth batter forms. Note that the batter should be very thick. My 8 cup food processor could barely fit the whole batter and blend it together<br><br>

- These brownies are naturally sweetened with dates. Using the same amount by weight of raisins or figs would also work as a replacement for dates. For a lower sugar option, replace both the dates and the milk with overripe bananas, about 3 large or 330 g<br><br>

- Transfer the batter to the pan. Using a silicone spatula, smooth out the batter. Lightly wetting your fingers and using your hands to spread it to all sides make it easier and stick less. Optionally, top with chocolate chips.<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out fairly clean. A few crumbs left is generally ok. The brownies will firm up much more as they cool, so they should look a bit underdone<br><br>

- Let cool totally in the fridge for a few hours (ideally overnight) before slicing and enjoying
