Description: These brownies spawned from me trying to make my <a href="three-ingredient-brownies">Three Ingredient Brownie Bites</a>, where I wanted to swap the banana and peanut butter for pumpkin puree and pumpkin seed butter.  The batter was much thicker, so I added some extra ingredients, swirled in a pumpkin topping, and thus these Double Pumpkin Brownies were born.  They're sugar, nut,  and gluten free, moist and fudgy, and simple to make!
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, combine together pumpkin puree and pumpkin seed butter until well combined with an electric hand mixer<br><br>

- <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> can be used instead of pumpkin puree (here's a secret - this is actually sweet potato, but you didn't hear that from me)<br><br>

- Add in the rest of the brownie ingredients (egg, sweetener, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and cocoa). Mix with your hand mixer until a smooth and slightly thick batter forms<br><br>

- Transfer the batter to a parchment line 8" square pan that's lined with parchment paper and sprayed with oil<br><br>

- Wipe your both with a paper towel, and beat together the swirl topping ingredients (puree, seed butter, and liquid sweetener) with a hand mixer until fully combined<br><br>

- Dollop the pumpkin topping on top of the brownies, and swirl as best as you can with a toothpick. I mixed it in too much here; ideally you can get more visible streaks of orange against the brown brownie background<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 20 minutes. A toothpick to the center will come out slightly wet with some crumbs. It should not be clean<br><br>
