Description: After my <a href="/misc/boxed-brownie-experiment">Fat Replacements in Boxed Brownies</a> experiment, where I found that sweet potato was the best oil replacement in brownies, I wanted to make a homemade batch using <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> as the base. The result is a low calorie brownie that is still just as delicious and fudgy as the one from the box. They're also nut free too, and have an increased fiber content. There's no weird ingredients; just sweetened by either sugar free syrup, maple syrup, or honey.  For more sweet potato based desserts, see my chewy <a href="sweet-potato-cookies">Sweet Potato Peanut Butter Cookies</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F and line an 8" square baking pan with parchment paper. Optionally, spray the paper with oil<br><br>

- In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients - oat flour, cocoa powder, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.  Almond flour or whole wheat flour should also work in place of oat flour<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, mix together the wet ingredients - syrup, egg, applesauce, vanilla, melted chocolate and puree. Below are some substitutions if you desire
- <br>&emsp;1. Maple syrup or honey would work in place of sugar free syrup
- <br>&emsp;2. If using melted chocolate, use a bittersweet (at least 72%) or unsweetened bar
- <br>&emsp;3. Melted chocolate can be replaced 1 oz (28 g) each of cocoa powder and melted coconut oil
- <br>&emsp;4. Or try 2 tbsp (32 g) natural peanut butter in place of the melted chocolate
- <br>&emsp;5. For the puree, you can either choose a canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling), or make <br>&emsp;&emsp;some <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> or <a href="roasted-butternut-squash-puree">Roasted Butternut Squash Puree</a>.  Even <br>&emsp;&emsp;<a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> can be used for a sweeter and more cinnamon flavored brownie
- <br>&emsp;6. For a vegan version, replace the egg with an additional 1/4 cup (60 g) of sweet potato, pumpkin, or <br>&emsp;&emsp;butternut squash puree<br><br>

- Add the dry ingredients into the wet, sifting if necessary. Fold with a silicone spatula until fully combined; don't over mix. The batter should be pretty thick<br><br>

- Transfer the batter to your parchment lined pan, and smooth the top with your spatula<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 20 minutes, or until the center is just set to the touch and a toothpick comes out mostly clean with some wet crumbs<br><br>

- Let cool completely in the pan, preferably in the fridge for a few hours, before slicing with a plastic knife<br><br>
