Description: These delicious chocolate chip peanut butter cookies use sweet potatoes as a base, leaving them rich and chewy with much less fat. You can swap out the chocolate chips for chopped nuts or seeds to make them a breakfast cookie too!  You can use either <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> or <a href="roasted-butternut-squash-puree">Roasted Butternut Squash Puree</a> here, or just use canned pumpkin puree.  For more sweet potato based desserts, see my fudgy <a href="sweet-potato-brownies">Sweet Potato Brownies (SF)</a>
Instructions: 
- In a large, bowl, mash the sweet potato. Combine with the rest of the ingredients.  You can use either maple syrup or honey in place or sugar free syrup, or swap the chocolate chips for any other mix-in you desire<br><br>
