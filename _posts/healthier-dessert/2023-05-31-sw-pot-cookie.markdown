Description: These delicious chocolate chip peanut butter cookies use sweet potatoes as a base, leaving them rich and chewy with much less fat. You can swap out the chocolate chips for chopped nuts or seeds to make them a breakfast cookie too!  You can use either <a href="sweet-potato-puree">Roasted Sweet Potato Puree</a> or <a href="roasted-butternut-squash-puree">Roasted Butternut Squash Puree</a> here, or just use canned pumpkin puree.  For more sweet potato based desserts, see my fudgy <a href="sweet-potato-brownies">Sweet Potato Brownies (SF)</a>
Instructions: 
- In a large, bowl, combine all the ingredients with a hand mixer. The batter will be fairly wet<br><br>

- Scoop onto a parchment lined cookie sheet with a cookie scoop. Lightly wet your hands, and lightly flatten the cookies and round into a circle (they won't spread as they bake)<br><br>

- Bake at 375F for about 10 minutes, or until lightly golden brown and set. Transfer to a wire rack to cool
