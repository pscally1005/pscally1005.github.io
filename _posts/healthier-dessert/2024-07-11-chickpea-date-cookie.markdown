Description: Delicious cookies made from a base of beans, dates, and natural nut butter.  Sugar free (depending on your chocolate) and oil free.  They can be vegan too (swap the milk for water and use vegan chocolate).  This is variation 1 - a standard chocolate chip cookie version. I have two other types of these cookies - <a href="/recipes/protein-chickpea-date-cookies">Peanut Protein Bean Cookies</a> and <a href="/recipes/double-chocolate-chickpea-date-cookies">Double Chocolate Chickpea Cookies</a>.  Make them all and taste test them to see which ones you like the best!
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.<br><br>

- Add the beans, dates, nut butter, milk (or water), vanilla, and salt to a food processor and blend until smooth<br><br>

- I've used almond butter here, but any nut butter will work, like peanut or cashew butter.  For a nut free option, use sunflower or pumpkin seed butter<br><br>

- For the beans, I've gone with chickpeas, but any other light colored bean will work, like navy, pinto, or cannellini beans.  I wouldn't recommend black or kidney beans, as the color will change<br><br>

- Add in baking soda and blend briefly, until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips with a silicone spatula. The batter should be very loose for a cookie dough.  You can refrigerate for about 30 minutes to harden it if you desire<br><br>

- Using a cookie scoop (mine is 1.5 tbsp), scoop the cookie dough onto to the pan. These cookies won't flatten or spread as they bake, and will only puff up slightly. Flatten to as wide as you'd like the finished cookies to be<br><br>

- Bake for about 14 minutes at 350F, or until the tops and edges are lightly golden brown and the cookies are set to the touch<br><br>
