Description: These oatmeal fudge bars combine together the delicious internet healthy dessert ingredients - bananas, chocolate, peanut butter, and oats. They can be totally added sugar free if you use sugar free chocolate chips, but here I've decided to make a homemade honey sweetened chocolate for the fudge filling instead. The bottom crust and crumble topping have a delicious banana peanut butter flavor, and the fudge is rich, chocolatey, and full of delicious peanut buttery goodness
Instructions: 
- In a bowl, combine together the crust/crumble ingredients - mashed banana, honey, vanilla, PB2, and quick oats. Mix until well combined<br><br>

- In a lined 8" baking pan, spread 2/3 of the oat mixture. Lightly wet your hands to prevent sticking, and flatten to an even thickness<br><br>
