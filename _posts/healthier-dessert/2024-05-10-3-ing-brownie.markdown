Description: These simple and healthy brownie bites are made with just 3 ingredients - pureed bananas, nut butter, and cocoa powder. These taste like delicious chocolate peanut butter banana bread, but dense and fudgy, as all brownies should be. Feel free to add any extra flavors such as vanilla or cinnamon, or any mix-ins like chocolate chips or chopped nuts. The nutrition facts are per brownie bite.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and spray a mini muffin pan with oil<br><br>

- Choose bananas that are as brown and soft as possible for the sweetest brownies. I've used <a href="natural-peanut-butter">natural peanut butter</a> here, but any other natural nut or seed butter will work, like almond butter or sunflower seed butter. <a href="apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a> or unsweetened applesauce would also work in place of bananas. Using PB2 in place of cocoa powder would probably work to make it a blondie instead and add more protein, but I haven't personally tried it yet<br><br>

- In a food processor, blend the bananas, nut butter, and cocoa powder until smooth<br><br>

- Optionally, mix in some other flavors. You can use 1 tsp (5 g) vanilla (or almond) extract, 1/4 tsp (1.5 g) salt, 2 tsp (5 g) cinnamon, or 1/3 cup (60 g) of mix-ins (chocolate chips, chopped nuts, raisins, etc.). For a cakier brownie, add a 1/2 tsp (2.4 g) of baking powder<br><br>

- Evenly divide your batter across 24 mini muffin cups. They won't rise as they bake (unless you add the baking powder), so fill them completely<br><br>

- Bake the brownie bites at 350F for about 12 minutes, or until the tops look black (don't worry, they're not burned) and the top is just firm. A toothpick to the center should NOT come out clean<br><br>

- Alternatively, you can bake as regular brownies in a parchment lined and greased 8" square pan.  Bake for about 30 minutes. If you jiggle the pan, the center should just be set, and a toothpick should come out with some moist crumbs.  Note that the nutrition facts are for 24 mini muffins, and an 8" would be cut into 16 pieces.  Just multiply all the values by 1.5 to get the nutritional information for 1 square brownie<br><br>

- Refrigerate for at least 4 hours (ideally overnight) so the brownies can set before removing from the pan
