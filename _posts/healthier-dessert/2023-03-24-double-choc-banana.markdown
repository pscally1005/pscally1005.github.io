Description: Banana bread is a great dessert for a crowd, and this healthy chocolate banana bread is a great way to still feel your best at sweets time. It's very similar to my blueberry muffins and breakfast banana bread recipes.  Check out my <a href="pbj-muffin">Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins</a> and my <a href="banana-bread">Breakfast Banana Bread</a> for similar recipes
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F, and line a bread pan with parchment paper. Spray the inside of the paper as well<br><br>

- Whisk together dry ingredients (oats, cornstarch, cocoa, baking soda, and salt) in a bowl<br><br>

- In a separate bowl, mash a banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients (maple syrup, applesauce, yogurt, peanut butter, and egg) to the bowl and mix<br><br>

- Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and combine with a silicone spatula.  Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 350F for about 60 minutes. A toothpick should come out slightly dirty, and the internal temperature will be around 190F.  You can also bake them as 36 mini muffins for about 15 minutes<br><br>
