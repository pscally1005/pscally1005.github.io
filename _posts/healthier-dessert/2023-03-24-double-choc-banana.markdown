Description: Banana bread is a great breakfast or dessert for a crowd, and this healthy chocolate banana bread is a great way to still feel great at sweets time. It's very similar to my blueberry muffins and breakfast banana bread recipes.  Check out my <a href="pbj-muffin">Peanut Butter and Jelly Muffins</a> and my <a href="banana-bread">Breakfast Banana Bread</a> for similar recipes
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F, and line a bread pan with parchment paper. Spray the inside of the paper as well<br><br>

- Whisk together dry ingredients (oat flour, cornstarch, cocoa, baking soda, and salt) in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mash a banana. Add the rest of the wet ingredients (maple syrup, applesauce, yogurt, and egg) to the bowl and mix<br><br>

- Pour the dry ingredients into the wet, and combine.  Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Transfer the batter to the lined pan.  Cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 350F for 55 minutes. You can also bake them as 32 mini muffins for 16 minutes<br><br>

- Let cool completely in the fridge for about an hour, then slice
