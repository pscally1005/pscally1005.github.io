Description: This frozen yogurt base can be easily customized into chocolate, fruity, vanilla, mint, or almond flavors. It's higher in protein, sugar free (with monk fruit, or refined sugar free with honey), filling, and a perfect dessert to end off your night. They can be made individually in air tight containers, or in 1 big pan to scoop out of.
Instructions: 
- This can either be made with full fat greek yogurt, or nonfat greek yogurt plus olive oil (1 tbsp, 15g).  For a sweetener, you have the choice of either liquid stevia/monk fruit (1 tsp, 5g), or honey/maple syrup (1/4 cup, 80g).  Here, I'll use the fat free yogurt with EVOO, and liquid stevia<br><br>

- Combine all ingredients together in a food processor, and blend to fully incorporate and whip air into the mixture. Scrape down the sides, and process until light and fluffy<br><br>

- Using a spatula, transfer the mixture to a square pan, and even out. Cover with plastic wrap, and freeze for 45 minutes. You can also use an airtight container for single serving portions<br><br>

- Remove from the freezer, and churn with your spatula. Smooth out again, cover, and freeze for another 2 hours, repeating this every 30 minutes.<br><br>

- These are 2 batches after the 2 hours. Both are made with whole milk Greek yogurt, with the one on the left being sweetened with monk fruit, and the right one being sweetened with honey. The water in the honey makes it a bit creamier, and it's sugar lowers the freezing point, so keep that in mind<br><br>

- When frozen, you can serve immediately as soft serve (in chilled bowls), or freeze for another 1-2 to scoop as harder ice cream texture.  If frozen overnight, let it soften on the counter for 30 minutes before serving
