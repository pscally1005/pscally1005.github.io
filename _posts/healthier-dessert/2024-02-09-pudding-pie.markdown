Description: This chocolate pudding pie is made with a homemade crust (same as my peanut butter banana pie) and coconut and chocolate based filling. It's an ice box pie, meaning the filling isn't baked, just cook on the stove, put in the pan, and chill in the fridge. It's simple, tasty, and healthier than traditional.
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 325F. In a food processor, blend the nuts and oats until finely chopped. Blend in the rest of the crust ingredients (maple syrup, almond milk, cocoa powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt). It should feel like damp sand, and come together when pressed<br><br>

- Press the crust into an 8" pan, bringing the crust up the walls a little bit if you can. Prick the bottom with a fork a few times<br><br>

- Bake for 10 minutes, or until firm. Transfer to the fridge to completely cool<br><br>

- Add all filling ingredients (coconut milk, almond milk, cocoa powder, cornstarch, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt) to a medium sized saucepan over medium heat. Cook until thick and bubbly, stirring constantly with a whisk, about 10 minutes<br><br>
