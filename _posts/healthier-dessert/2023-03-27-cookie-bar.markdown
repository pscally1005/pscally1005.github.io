Description: The classic Internet/Pinterest/TikTok healthy dessert is some combination of bananas, chocolate chips, oats, and peanut butter (I'm sure you've noticed). This recipe is my take on that formula, and works really well out of the freezer as a dessert or even a breakfast. You could also use some protein powder in place of oats if you so desire!
Instructions: 
- Line a tupperware or 8" baking pan with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a large bowl or food processor, mix together the ingredients. If using a bowl, mash the banana with the back of a fork before adding everything else<br><br>

- For a higher protein version, you can replace the oats with a 50/50 blend of whey and casein. If using unflavored, add about 1 tsp of liquid monk fruit too. Note that since casein absorbs liquid so well, that you'll only need 120g (60g each whey and casein) protein powder, as opposed to 160g oat flour<br><br>

- Optionally fold in some chocolate chips<br><br>

- Spread mix evenly into parchment paper. The batter is thick, but make it as even as possible.<br><br>

- Freeze, then slice. Store in the freezer
