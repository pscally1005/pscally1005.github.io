Description: Peanut butter pie is a classic Christmas stable, but it's filled with tons of unhealthy fats and sugars, making it super calorie dense. This recipe boosts the protein content while cutting back on the sugar and fat, but still keeping that great flavor, while being dairy free. It combines a peanut flour crust with the peanut butter and banana filling that you'll love.  For the filling, either make a standard <a href="natural-peanut-butter">Homemade Natural Nut Butter</a>, or go double chocolate with <a href="nutella">Roasted Hazelnut Nutella (SF)</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 325F. In a food processor, blend the nuts and oats until finely chopped. Blend in the rest of the crust ingredients (maple syrup, almond milk, cocoa powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt). It should feel like damp sand, and come together when pressed<br><br>

- Press the crust mixture into a circular pan, bringing up the walls if you can.  Prick the bottom with a fork a handful of times.  Bake for 10 minutes, or until firm. Transfer to the fridge to fully cool<br><br>

- Mix together the filling ingredients in a large bowl with a hand mixer - bananas, peanut butter, PB2, almond milk, maple syrup, oat flour, and vanilla<br><br>

- Spoon the mixture onto the crust, smoothing with a silicone spatula. Optionally, top with chocolate chips (1/4 cup, 60g), or here I used a crumbled chocolate chip cookie. Chill for about 4 hours before slicing
