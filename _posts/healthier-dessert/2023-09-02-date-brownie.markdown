Description: These date brownies are my favorite healthy baked dessert I've ever made, and one you can certainly serve to a crowd without people realizing they're healthy. These brownies are much more than just a healthy substitute for the real deal, as they lead me to deleting my classic brownie recipe after tasting them.
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F and line an 8" square pan with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper<br><br>

- If necessary, soak your dates in warm water if they feel too dry. Set the liquid aside to use for something else. If you don't have dates, you could use an equal weight of raisins (1 cup, 160 g), or instead use 1/4 cup (80 g) of a liquid sweetener, like maple syrup or honey<br><br>

- In a food processor, blend the dates until a smooth paste forms. Blend in the rest of the ingredients.  It's best to use bananas that are turning brown, but unsweetened applesauce will work as a replacement.  You can also use peanut butter in place of almond butter<br><br>

- Add batter to the pan. Optionally top with 1-2 tbsp (15-30 g) chocolate chips, minis preferred<br><br>

- Bake for 30 minutes uncovered (if using syrup instead, bake an additional 10 minutes, covered)

- Let cool completely before slicing<br><br>

- You can also bake these as mini muffins for 20 minutes. Makes about 24 mini muffins
