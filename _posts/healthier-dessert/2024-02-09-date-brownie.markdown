Description: These date brownies are my favorite healthy baked dessert I've ever made, and one you can certainly serve to a crowd without people realizing they're healthy. These brownies are much more than just a healthy substitute for the real deal, as they lead me to deleting my classic brownie recipe after tasting them.
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F and line an 8" square pan with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper<br><br>

- (Soak dates in water if needed to soften them. Set liquid aside to use for something else). In a food processor, blend the dates until a smooth paste forms. Blend in the rest of the ingredients<br><br>

- Add batter to the pan. Optionally top with 2 tbsp (30 g) chocolate chips<br><br>

- Bake for 30 minutes uncovered (if using syrup instead, bake an additional 10 minutes, covered)

- Let cool completely before slicing<br><br>

- Can also bake as mini muffins for 20 minutes. Makes about 24 mini muffins<br><br>
