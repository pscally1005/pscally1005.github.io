Description: This easy fudge is made with just 3 simple ingredients - melted coconut oil, cocoa powder, and natural peanut butter. I love this bittersweet treat, but you can add some maple syrup to taste if you like it a bit sweeter than I do
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, microwave coconut oil for about a minute, until fully melted. Stir in cocoa powder and peanut butter. Add liquid sweetener to taste if desired<br><br>

- Transfer to a parchment lined container (mine are 6.2 x 4.5 "). If you want to scale this up, double the recipe for a 9 x 5" bread pan, or triple for an 8" square pan<br><br>
