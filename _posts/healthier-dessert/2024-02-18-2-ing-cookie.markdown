Description: My leftover ripe banana and container of peanuts were eyeing me funny, so I created fresh nut butter to use in these simple cookies. They have a good source of fat and protein, low in sugar (added sugar free without the chocolate), and come in at around 80 calories for a peanut butter cookie (still less than 100 with the chocolate).
Instructions: 
- In a medium bowl, mash your banana with the back of a fork. Mix in the peanut butter, and your base recipe is done<br><br>

- You can also add in some cinnamon (1/2 tsp), extracts (1/2 tsp almond or vanilla), or salt (small pinch) for extra flavor<br><br>

- Scoop the dough onto a lined cookie sheet (I used a 1 tbsp cookie scoop). Flatten the dough with your fingers to about 1/4" thick<br><br>

- Optionally, top each cookie with chocolate chips (2 tbsp, 30 g), about 5-6 per cookie (even better if you had minis)<br><br>

- Bake in a 350F oven for about 8 minutes. Transfer the pan to the fridge to cool the cookies completely
