Description: These soft baked peanut butter cookies are naturally sweetened with honey (or maple syrup), and still feature that classic criss-cross design on the top. They're all about the natural peanut butter, have a subtle honey taste, gluten free, and not crumbly!  Make some <a href="natural-peanut-butter">Homemade Natural Nut Butter</a> for an even better cookie, and maybe try them with almond or sunflower butter instead!
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, beat together peanut butter, sweetener, applesauce (or banana), and vanilla with a hand mixer (or fork) until smooth, about 1 minute<br><br>

- Add the cornstarch, baking powder, and half of the oats. Combine with a fork. Add in the other half of the oats and mix until fully combined.  Chill cookies to firm up a little bit if needed before shaping, about 30 minutes<br><br>

- Scoop into cookies and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Lightly flatten, and cross with a fork. Wet the fork to prevent sticking if necessary.<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for 8 minutes. Let cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Optionally drizzle the cookies with melted chocolate
