Description: These oatmeal cookies are a healthier alternative to the classic chocolate chip cookie. They can be totally sugar free if using sugar free syrup and sugar free chocolate chips, but you can also use maple syrup (or honey) and regular dark chocolate chips if that's what you desire.
Instructions: 
- In a large bowl, bring together the wet ingredients (vanilla, applesauce, and sweeteener). And in the dry ingredients (oat flour, PB2, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt), and mix together. You can use oat flour instead of PB2 (same amount by weight), but add in 1/4 tsp salt if you do<br><br>

- Fold in the chocolate. Let the dough chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes to harden<br><br>

- Preheat your oven to 350F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Scoop dough onto the sheet, and flatten into a cookie (they won't spread or rise as they bake)<br><br>
