Description: This smoothie can be had for breakfast, but is honestly so good it could easily pass as a milkshake for dessert. Feel free to add some protein powder for an added nutrient boost
Instructions: 
- A few hours (or day) before, add half a banana to a Ziploc bag, and store in the freezer<br><br>

- Blend the banana, nut butter, and milk until creamy in a small blender or electric food chopper<br><br>

- Add in cloves, cocoa, almond extract, and any more milk if desired. Blend to fully combine. Add some monk fruit if you want it sweeter. Add some mint extract for a subtle mint flavor if you like, but be careful not to add too much. Blend in some protein powder too<br><br>

- Transfer to a medium glass and serve
