Description: Here's my simple formula for the perfect protein packed fruit <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#smoothie">smoothie</a>. I always use a banana, and whatever frozen fruit I have in my kitchen at the time. The yogurt and protein powder help to make it a bit more filling as a meal that could hold you over until lunch. This also works well as a smoothie bowl, just use a frozen banana.
Instructions: 
- Blend all ingredients together in a blender, and pour into a glass<br><br>

- Turn into a smoothie bowl by using a frozen banana and leaving out the milk, and blending in a food processor instead.  Transfer to a bowl. Add any toppings if desired, such as nuts or seeds<br><br>
