Description: I've never heard of these so-called "wellness shots" until recently, but thought they sounded like a good idea. They're anti-inflammatory, and utilize herbal medicine and spices, such as ginger, turmeric, and black pepper. It's mildly sweet from the orange and coconut water, and great to sip on (or take a shot of) in the morning. Plus you can turn the leftover pulp into Wellness Proteins Bites. A 2:1 deal, no waste!
Instructions: 
- Using a knife, peel the skins off the orange and lemon, and add to a large blender. Wash your turmeric and ginger with water, cut into chunks and add to the blender. Add in the black pepper, cayenne, oil, and coconut water<br><br>

- Blend on high for about a minute until smooth<br><br>

- Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl, and pour in the smoothie. Use a spoon to grind the pulp against the grains to get out all the liquid<br><br>

- Transfer the strained liquid to a mason jar, and store in the fridge for a few days<br><br>

- Don't throw away the pulp! I mixed mine with the below ingredients to make anti-inflammatory wellness protein bites<br>
- 1 scoop (30 g) unflavored casein<br>
- 1 tsp (4 g) ground cinnamon<br>
- Tiny pinch of salt<br>
- 1/2 tbsp (7 g) melted coconut oil<br>
- Mix together, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to harden the oil. Roll into about 12 balls, and store in the fridge.
