Description: I used to never be a fan of protein shakes, but upon switching to unflavored protein powder I was able to customize them a lot more and avoid the gross sucralose taste, in my opinion. I'll normally have this to add some extra protein at a meal if I'm missing a protein source, like a meatless salad.
Instructions: 
- Place the banana peel in a pot and cover it with water. Cover, and let boil for 10 minutes to soften and infuse the flavor<br><br>
