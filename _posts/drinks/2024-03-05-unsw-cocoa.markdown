Description: This hot cocoa drink is fully unsweetened, and is simply just cocoa powder and cinnamon whisked into any simmering milk of choice. It's great for winter time, with rich chocolatey taste without all the sugar.  Or you can make my <a href="hot-chocolate">High Protein Hot Chocolate</a>
Instructions: 
- In a mug, whisk the cocoa and cinnamon into a splash of milk (about 2 tbsp). Optionally, add some cinnamon, a small pinch of salt, or a dash of vanilla (or all 3). Whisk until fully combined, then add in the rest of the milk. This helps prevent clumping and allows for everything to be fully incorporated<br><br>

- Microwave on high for 1-2 minutes, or until desired temperature is reached
