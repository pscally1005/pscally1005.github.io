Description: Typical hot chocolate is full of added sugars, which is not what I'm about. The protein makes this like a hot protein shake, and its sweetened with monk fruit (or stevia) too. This is great after being outside in the snow for hours, and is a much healthier way to enjoy the classic drink.
Instructions: 
- Add ingredients to a medium saucepot<br><br>

- Heat over medium, whisking frequently, until warm (but not boiling) and creamy.<br><br>

- Serve immediately, makes 1 serving. Can also be stored in the fridge for later as chocolate milk<br><br>

- Alternatively you can mix in a shaker bottle, then transfer to a glass or mug and microwave for 1:30
