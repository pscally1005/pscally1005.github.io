Description: Here's a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe. I usually only make and post healthy recipes, but it's okay to enjoy the classic treat from time to time. Chocolate chip cookies are usually what I make to bring for an occasion; that way I can have 1 or 2 every so often, and I can leave someone else with the rest.  I made these to celebrate Vic getting into UF for her Master's Degree.  Brownies are the other classic dessert, so check out my <a href="/recipes/brownies">Classic Fudgy Brownies</a>
Instructions: 
- Mix together sugar, honey, and (melted) butter with a hand mixer until fluffy. Beat in egg and mix in vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Fully combine, then mix in the flour. Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- Chill the dough in the fridge (at least 30 minutes) if using melted butter. This step is not necessary if butter is softened<br><br>

- Scoop the cookies, roll into balls, and place onto a parchment lined cookie sheet.  These will flatten and spread as they bake, so leave plenty of room in between.  Don't do more than 12 on a standard size cookie sheet<br><br>

- Bake for about 8-9 min at 350F, or until lightly golden brown on the bottom and the sides. Allow them to cool on the pan for a few minutes, until they can be safely scraped off with a spatula without breaking.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool
