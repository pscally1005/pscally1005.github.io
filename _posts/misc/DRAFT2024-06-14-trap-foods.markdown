<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;I wanted to put together a list of foods that people consider to be healthy, but are really just either a product of good marketing or misinformation.  These foods are typically referred to "Trap Foods", or "Fake Healthy Foods", as they can lure customers into thinking they're making better decisions, when in realty these "healthy" alternatives can be just as bad, if not worse

<br><i><font size="+2">Cereal</font></i><br>
&emsp;"Part of a complete breakfast" is what we were taught growing up.  That children need cereal, and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  That's a hell of a successful marketing campaign.  Cereal is probably one of the worst things you can eat in the morning; it's essentially just a bowl of added sugar.  Don't worry guys, it's fat free though (as if that's really helping it's case).

&emsp;It doesn't take a nutritionist to realize that Lucky Charms or Froot Loops are nothing more than a treat, but where the real "danger" lies is the cereals that are instead marketed as healthy.  I'm talking about things like Honey Nut Cheerios, Raisin Bran, and any of the other "boring" adult cereals that aren't "sugar bombs".  Except they are.  For a 1 cup (36 g) serving of <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/honey-nut-cheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, you'll run yourself 12 g of added sugar and 140 calories, the exact same as in <a href="https://www.luckycharms.com/products/original-lucky-charms">Lucky Charms</a>.  Oh and that "can help lower cholesterol" claim, only <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/original-cheerios">Original Cheerios</a> actually have the American Heart Association certification on it.  And let's be honest, no one eats just 1 cup of cereal.

&emsp;If you're going to eat breakfast cereal, go with a sugar free option like plain cheerios or unsweetened puffed rice, and instead add flavors using fruit.  Original Cheerios only have 1 g of added sugar per serving, and the serving size is larger (1.5 cups as opposed to 1 cup).  Don't be fooled by that either!  Even then cereal still isn't the healthiest breakfast; it's still a bowl of empty refined carbs with no healthy fats or proteins, but at least this way it can actually be "part of a complete breakfast".

&emsp;Don't know why I just came out swinging with a vendetta against General Mills, the rest will be toned down.  Probably because I've personally been duped by this in the past, and it's a very common trap food.  Look for cereals with no added sugars, whole grains, and high in fiber.  Anything else is junk food with a good marketing team.

<br><i><font size="+2">Oatmeal</font></i><br>
&emsp;Okay so you've gotten past cereal, but surley oatmeal is safe right?  Think again
