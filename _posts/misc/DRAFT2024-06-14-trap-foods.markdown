<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;I wanted to put together a list of foods that people consider to be healthy, but are really just either a product of good marketing or misinformation.  These foods are typically referred to "Trap Foods", or "Fake Healthy Foods", as they can lure customers into thinking they're making better decisions, when in realty these "healthy" alternatives can be just as bad, if not worse

<div id="cereal"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Cereal</font></i><br>
&emsp;"Part of a complete breakfast" is what we were taught growing up.  That children need cereal, and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  That's a hell of a successful marketing campaign.  Cereal is probably one of the worst things you can eat in the morning; it's essentially just a bowl of added sugar.  Don't worry guys, it's fat free though (as if that's really helping it's case).

&emsp;It doesn't take a nutritionist to realize that Lucky Charms or Froot Loops are nothing more than a treat, but where the real "danger" lies is the cereals that are instead marketed as healthy.  I'm talking about things like Honey Nut Cheerios, Raisin Bran, and any of the other "boring" adult cereals that aren't "sugar bombs".  Except they are.  For a 1 cup (36 g) serving of <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/honey-nut-cheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, you'll run yourself 12 g of added sugar and 140 calories, the exact same as in <a href="https://www.luckycharms.com/products/original-lucky-charms">Lucky Charms</a>.  Oh and that "can help lower cholesterol" claim, only <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/original-cheerios">Original Cheerios</a> actually have the American Heart Association certification on it.  And let's be honest, no one eats just 1 cup of cereal.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/cereal.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you're going to eat breakfast cereal, go with a sugar free option like plain cheerios or unsweetened puffed rice, and instead add flavors using fruit.  Original Cheerios only have 1 g of added sugar per serving, and the serving size is larger (1.5 cups as opposed to 1 cup).  Don't be fooled by that either!  Even then cereal still isn't the healthiest breakfast; it's still a bowl of empty refined carbs with no healthy fats or proteins, but at least this way it can actually be "part of a complete breakfast".

&emsp;Don't know why I just came out swinging with a vendetta against General Mills, the rest will be toned down.  Probably because I've personally been duped by this in the past, and it's a very common trap food.  Look for cereals with no added sugars, whole grains, and high in fiber.  Anything else is junk food with a good marketing team.

<div id="oats"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Oatmeal</font></i><br>
&emsp;Okay so you've gotten past cereal, but surley oatmeal is safe right?  Think again.  Oats can be a great addition to your diet: they're a whole grain, high in fiber low fat, versatile, delicious, and gluten free.  They also contain a fair bit of manganese and iron, and are rich in antioxidants.  It even boasts about being "heart healthy" (so does cereal) on the box.  So what's the problem?

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/oatmeal.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;The main issue isn't with oatmeal, but how it's prepared.  I'm mainly talking about flavored packets of oatmeal here, like ones in the image above.  Unfortunately, these are really no different nutritionally from a bowl of sugary cereal; it's just warm now.  These packets are loaded with added sugars.  When it comes to oatmeal for breakfast, make it yourself from plain oats, and sweeten it with fruit and a small amount of maple syrup or honey if desired.  Also add some healthy fats like chopped nuts or nut butter, and some protein with yogurt or protein powder (or both!)

<div id="granola"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Granola Bars</font></i><br>
&emsp;Oatmeal flows us nicely into granola bars.  Usually though of as a healthy boring snack, these are actually much worse than they seem.  Granola and granola bars are loaded with added sugars; just 1 Chewy Chocolate Chip Granola Bar has 7 g of added sugar in a 24 g serving.  Do you know what else has the same amount of added sugar?  2 Chips Ahoy cookies.

&emsp;The vast majority of bars on the market contain sugar (or some type of sugar) as one of the first 3 ingredients on the label, making them a dessert.  Don't think Nature Valley, Nutrigrain, Kind Bars, or Clif Bars are any better.  I will say I used to be a huge fan of all 4 of these, and Clif Bars in particular serve a purpose.  On a long hike or after a hard workout, the simple sugars in Clif Bars are actually exactly what your body needs to replenish energy, and the protein aids in recovery.  Just don't eat them as a day to day snack.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/bars-1.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you're going to get a bar, I'd recommend either Larabar or RxBars; both are made with dates and nuts, and contain no added sugar or artificial sweeteners.  RxBars even have some protein powder as well.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/bars-2.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
<div id="trail-mix"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Trail Mix</font></i><br>
&emsp;Trail mix is the next step from granola, where you essentially just remove the oats, and instead have a mix of nuts and candy.  <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">Nuts</a> are healthy, but can be overdone (see below).  But the main problem with trail mix is the chocolate chips or M&Ms.  Trail mix can be a great snack, especially when on a trail (duh), where the salt, fat, and sugar are great for when you're out exercising.

&emsp;But don't be fooled into thinking it's healthy just because it contains nuts, just like how granola isn't healthy just because it contains oats.  Look out for the <a rel="" target="" href="#chocolate">chocolate</a> and <a rel="" target="" href="#dried-fruit">dried fruit</a>.  A lot of trail mixes can contain a surprising amount of added sugar.  Plus, it's very high in fat and calories, so it's very easy to overeat.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/trail-mix.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you really love trail mix, you should consider making it yourself.  It's cheaper and healthier, as well as dead simple.  Just mix together nuts, dark chocolate, and unsweetened dried fruit in a bag, and you're done.  You can check out my <a href="/recipes/trail-mix">Mixed Nuts and Chocolate Trail Mix</a> for a easy typical trail mix, or my <a href="/recipes/air-fried-trail-mix">Air Fryer Trail Mix</a> for a roasted varation with nuts, bananas, and chickpeas.

<div id="nuts"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Nuts</font></i><br>
&emsp;Nuts, just like oats, can be a very healthful addition to your diet, or they can be the end of it, depending upon how they're prepared and consumed.  Nuts are rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, fiber, selenium, manganese, and contain a fair bit of protein.  They can also help in raising your HDL.  The problem is that nuts are insanely calorically dense.  They're very high in fat, where just a 1 oz (28 g) serving contains about 160 calories.  Calories aren't everything, and fat is essential for you, but just don't overdo it on nuts (as I tend do to).

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/nuts.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Additionally, make sure to get plain nuts.  Ideally, your nuts are dry roasted; either unsalted or lightly salted are okay depending on your tastes and salt intake.  Just stay away from flavored nuts, like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Honey-Roasted-Peanuts-34-5-oz/10448380?from=/search">honey roasted peanuts</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Honey-Roast-Pecans-7oz/636142562?from=/search">candied pecans</a>.  These contain lots of added sugars, unhealthy oils, and unnecessary ingredients.  Even <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Dry-Roasted-Peanuts-16-oz/10448531?from=/search">regularly salted nuts</a> tend to contain a paragraph of ingredients.  Stick to just nuts and salt, and always weigh out your serving of nuts.  Any more than a handful of nuts is probably too much.

<div id="peanut-butter"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Peanut Butter</font></i><br>
&emsp;<a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">Natural nut butter</a> is the nectar of the gods.  Not only is it absolutely delicious, but it's very good for you.  Peanut butter has all the same downisdes as regular nuts though, but even worse, as it's even easier to over eat.  Just a large spoonful, or about 2 tbsp (32 g), of peanut butter contains 190 calories.  So while its packed with healthy fats and micronutrient, you need to be very mindful of your nut butter consumption, as the calories can add up very quick.  If you're eating peanut butter with your apple, you'll probably end up consuming twice as many caloreis from peanut butter than from the apple itself.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/pb.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;However, overconsumption isn't even the main problem with peanut butter.  The problem is the fake "no stir" peanut butter, that also contain hydroginated oils and sugar.  This peanut spread is cheaper than even buying your own peanuts and grinding them yourself, just fueling the problem (remember: sugar and palm oil are very cheap).  Just like with regular nuts, make sure to only buy peanut butter (or any nut butter) that is labeled as natural, and contains only nuts and salt.  My favorite brands (when I don't make it myself) are <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Teddie-All-Natural-Smooth-Peanut-Butter-36-oz/640652420?from=/search">Teddie</a> and Trader Joe's.  Stay away from any flavored nut butters, especially...

<div id="nutella"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Nutella</font></i><br>
&emsp;...nutella.  Nutella has a lot of nerve to call itself hazelnut spread, considering its just a sugar and fat spread.  A jar of nutella is 58% sugar and 30% palm oil; only just 13% of the jar contains actual hazelnuts.  Nutella is way more of a jelly substitute than a peanut butter one.  A 2 tbsp (37 g) serving contains a whopping 200 calories and 18 g of added sugar; that's 5 teaspoons!.  You know what contains 17 g of added sugar in the same serving size?  That's right, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Betty-Crocker-Rich-Creamy-Milk-Chocolate-Frosting-Gluten-Free-Frosting-16-oz/10311570?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Chocolate Frosting</a>, and the frosting is actually lower in fat and calories. And you and me both know we're going to eat more than just 1 serving.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/nutella.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you love nutella, then consider making it yourself, where you can control the sweetness, and totally eliminated the hydroginated oils.  I have a recipe for <a href="/recipes/nutella">Roasted Hazelnut Nutella</a> that's free of added sugars and oils.  Just roast and blend hazelnuts into a smooth nut butter, and add in some chocolate and bananas for sweetness.  Tastes way better than the jar, and isn't a total sugar bomb.

<div id="jelly"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Jelly and Jam</font></i><br>
&emsp;I love a good PB&J.  Which means using a good <a rel="" target="" href="#peanut-butter">peanut butter</a>, jelly, and <a rel="" target="" href="#bread">bread</a>.  Here, we're tackling jelly and jam though.  A jam is ideally just simmered fruit that's mildly sweetened, just like my <a href="/recipes/berry-jam">Low Sugar Berry Jam</a> or <a href="/recipes/strawberry-chia-jam">Strawberry Chia Jam</a>.  The problem is that most jellies and jams are just sugar spreads.  A 1 tbsp (20 g) serving of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Concord-Grape-Jelly-18-Ounces/10321567?from=/search">Smuckers Grape Jelly</a> contains 12 g of sugar.  That's 60% sugar (about the same as <a rel="" target="" href="#nutella">nutella</a>), and with none of the fiber from the whole fruit.  Even jellies that claim to be healthy, look out for the total sugar content, not just the added sugar content.  Unfortunately, fruit juice isn't considered added sugar on the label, but it's just concentrated fruit sugar, not the whole fruit.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/jam.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Outside of making your own jam, your best bets are any low sugar jam or jelly, with less than 4-5 g of added sugar per serving.  Trader Joe's has some good low sugar jellies, jams, and preserves.  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Good-Good-Keto-Friendly-Sweet-Strawberry-Jam-12-oz-1-Count/212702301?from=/search">Good Good</a> is also a good stevia sweetened jam brand, and this <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Low-Sugar-Reduced-Sugar-Strawberry-Preserves-15-5-Ounces/10308118?from=/search">Smuckers Low Sugar Strawberry Preserves</a> is a decent option.  Just stay away from any jellies labeled as "Sugar free" (like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Sugar-Free-Concord-Grape-Jam-with-Splenda-Brand-Sweetener-12-75-Ounces/10308139?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">this one</a>), as those are sweetened with <a rel="" target="" href="#sugar-substitutes">sucralose</a> and taste disgusting.
