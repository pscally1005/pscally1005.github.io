<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;Here's something I've always wondered:  What's cheaper, bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, or boneless skinless?  Obviously the price per pound of bone-in and skin-on thighs is lower.  But once you discard the bones and skin and are left with just meat, is it still cheaper?

<u><font size="+2">Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs</font></u><br>
&emsp;I normally have a hard time finding boneless skinless chicken thighs at the store, as the normal store brand doesn't carry it (only bone-in and skin-on).  Thus, I have to buy another brand of chicken, which might end up being more expensive than if the general store brand carried it.  Nevertheless, I can find chicken thighs for <b>$2.99 per pound</b>.  This packet of chicken below was 1.67 lbs, so it cost $4.99.

&emsp;On the other hand, this pack of bone-in skin-on chicken thighs costs <b>$[UNIT COST BEFORE] per pound</b>.  It weighs [WEIGHT AFTER] lbs, and costs a total of $[TOTAL COST].

&emsp;I should preface that I'm pretty bad at deboning chicken, so I will end up with some loss.  Taking the skin off is pretty simple, but the bone is trickier.  But after deboning all the thighs, I ended with a total meat weight of [WEIGHT AFTER].  For a total cost of $[TOTAL COST], that means that this costs <b>$[UNIT COST AFTER] per pound</b>.

<u><font size="+2">Conclusion</font></u><br>
&emsp;The cost each for boneless skinless and bone-in skin-on chicken thighs are <b>$2.99/lb</b>, and <b>$[UNIT COST AFTER]/lb</b>, respectively.  [WHICH ONE IS CHEAPER??]
