<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;You know those rotisserie chickens that grocery stores have?  The ones that are like 5 bucks for a whole small cooked chicken.  Yes they're super convenient, but here's the question I'm proposing:  Is it actually cheaper than buying and cooking your own chicken?

<u><font size="+2">Raw Chicken</font></u><br>
&emsp;How are we going to compare the price of cooked rotisserie chicken to raw chicken?  Since a rotisserie chicken is a mix of white meat (breast) and dark meat (thighs and wings), I'm going to assume a 50/50 split.  Therefore, I will be averaging the price per pound of boneless skinless chicken breast and boneless skinless chicken thighs to get the price per pound.  Thankfully, both chicken breast and thighs are each $2.99 per pound, which is strange; normally thighs are cheaper.  Whatever, I'm not complaining, that makes my math easier.

<br>
&emsp;Okay cool, so $2.99/lb, but that's for raw meat.  What about cooked?  I'm going to assume that meat loses about 25% of it's mass from water when cooked.  For example, a 4 oz (113 g) piece of raw chicken typically weighs about 3 oz (85 g) when cooked.  That would mean that 1 lb (454 g) of raw meat yields about 3/4 lb (340 g) cooked meat.  At $2.99 for 3/4 lb, that would mean that the cooked chicken costs <b>$3.99 per pound</b>.

&emsp;Now, let's compare the cost of cooking raw chicken ourselves to the cost of a rotisserie chicken.  This chicken cost me $[COST], and weighs [WEIGHT BEFORE] pounds.  This weight includes all the skin and bones though, what about just meat?  Discarding all the skin and bones, we are left with a total net weight of [WEIGHT AFTER] pounds.  At $[COST] for [WEIGHT AFTER] lbs of cooked chicken, this means that the unit cost of a rotisserie chicken is <b>$[UNIT COST] per pound</b>.

<u><font size="+2">Conclusion</font></u><br>
&emsp;The cost each for cooking your own chicken and buying a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken are <b>$2.99/lb</b>, and <b>$[UNIT COST]/lb</b>, respectively.  [WHICH ONE IS CHEAPER??]
