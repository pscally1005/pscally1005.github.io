<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;This post is essentially the opposite of my <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a>.  In that, I went through a long list "trap foods", or foods that are deceptively unhealthy desite common belief and marketing.  On the other hand, here I will be going through some foods that are often overshadowed.  Foods that are healthy, but often given a bad rap.

<div id="bananas" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Bananas</font></i><br>
&emsp;Bananas, like most fruits, and fairly high in sugar and carbs.  But that doesn't make them unhealthy; far from it.  Bananas are a good source of both fiber and potassium.  Remember that 10 grams of sugar from whole foods is not the same as 10 g of added sugar.  Fruit is packaged with water and fiber, slowing absorption and preventing blood sugar spikes.  Added sugar on the other hand is more "free"; it doesn't need to get broken down as much, causing your blood sugar to rise and increase your body's secretion of insulin.
<br><br>
&emsp;A banana is a delicious way to to flavor anything sweet.  Just mashing or slicing a banana into your breakfast is a great way to elevate your morning oatmeal or yogurt.  They're also great ingredients for <a href="/recipes/healthier-dessert">baking</a>, allowing you to cut back on both added sugars and added fat.  Mashed bananas (and unsweetened applesauce) work as a great replacement for butter and oil, while also providing delicious flavor and sweetness, allowing you to cut back on the sugar too!  Win-win.  Here are some stats of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Bananas%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">bananas</a> per 100 grams (about 1 medium banana):
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Calories</b>: 89
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Fat</b>: 0.3 g (0 %)
<br><b>Carbs</b>: 23 g (8 %)
<br>&emsp;<b>Fiber</b>: 2.6 g (20 %)

<div id="beans" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Beans</font></i><br>
&emsp;I feel like beans often get lumped into the other foods to eliminate when trying to clean up your diet and I'm not sure why.  Yeah they're high in carbs, but it's time to stop fearing whole food carbohydrates.  In addition to carbs, beans are a great cheap source of plant based protein.  And of course, who can forget about fiber!  Beans are loaded with fiber; they aren't called the music fruit for nothing!
<br><br>
&emsp;Beans are considered a high FODMAP food (they're high in oligosaccharides), meaning they may cause gas and bloating when eaten in excess.  Beans also contain an antinutrient called lectins, which may reduce the body's ability to absorb nutrients.  Though research is mixed whether lectins are harmful, lectin content can be reduced through soaking, cooking, and fermenting.
<br><br>
&emsp;But overall, beans are a great food.  As long as you can tolerate beans, there's no reason to not consume them daily.  They help regulate blood sugar, prevent fatty liver, benefit heart health, and improve gut health.  Beans aren't a complete protein, but they can become one when paired with <a rel="" target="" href="#brown-rice">brown rice</a>.  Here are some stats of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Beans%2C_drained_solids%2C_canned%2C_mature_seeds%2C_red%2C_kidney_nutritional_value.html?size=100%20g">red kidney beans</a> per 100 grams (about 1/2 cup):

<div id="brown-rice" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Brown rice</font></i><br>
&emsp;Of all the starches on the side of your plate, brown rice is one of the better ones.  It's not perfect, but it's basically just an easy carbohydrate source with a decent bit of micronutrients.  Brown rice is a whole grain, making it much healthier for you than <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#white-rice">white rice</a>.  It doesn't need to be fortified, since its nutrients aren't stripped away.  Looking at glycemic index, brown rice (54) is lower than white rice (72), meaning that it will cause less blood sugar spikes.  Additionally, brown rice contains higher amounts of B vitamins, potassium, and iron as compared to white rice.
<br><br>
&emsp;Rice is very versatile and easy to cook, making both a good side and a good base.  It's often paired with <a rel="" target="" href="#beans">beans</a>; a tasty combination that becomes a complete protein when mixed together.  Looking at <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Rice%2C_raw%2C_long-grain%2C_brown_nutritional_value.html?size=46%20g">brown rice</a>, for 1/4 cup (46 g) raw rice or 3/4 cup (130 g) cooked rice, we have the following:
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Calories</b>: 169

<br><b>Fat</b>: 1.5 g (2 %)
<br><b>Carbs</b>: 35 g (13 %)

<div id="coconut" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Coconut</font></i><br>
&emsp;One look at coconut and you may immediately turn away.  Being very high in fat, with nearly all of it being saturated fat, I can easily understand why people would think coconut is unhealthy.  But not all fat, or even all saturated fat, is created equal; see <a href="/misc/fats">Fat: The Innocent Criminal?</a>.  Being high in fat, coconut is high in calories, but that's where the downsides end. 
<br><br>
&emsp;<a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Nuts%2C_raw%2C_coconut_meat_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">Raw coconut meat</a> contains 33g of fat per 100 g, with 30 g being saturated fat.  These fats are mainly made up of a Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) called Lauric Acid.  MCTs are a different type of saturated fat than the ones found in animal products, as they are absorbed by the small intestine and are more readily used for energy.  MCTs have been shown to improve HDL levels, aid in blood sugar control, improve insulin resistance, and promote feelings of satiety.  
<br>
&emsp;Besides fat, coconut is also quite high in fiber.  <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Organic_coconut_flour_by_Bob%27s_Red_Mill_Natural_Foods%2C_Inc._547983_nutritional_value.html">Coconut flour</a> in particular contains 5 g of fiber in 2 tbsp (14 g).  Plus, coconut flour is defatted, containing only 1.5 g in 2 tbsp, making it lower in calories if that's a concern.  As for micronutrients, coconut is a good source of copper, manganese, iron, and selenium.
<br><br>
&emsp;I doubt you will be consuming a whole, fresh coconut, so I won't include nutrition facts for it here.  There's so many different types of coconut products for you to enjoy: <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Nuts%2C_not_sweetened%2C_dried_%28desiccated%29%2C_coconut_meat_nutritional_value.html?size=1+oz+%3D+28.35+g">unsweetened coconut flakes</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Oil%2C_coconut_nutritional_value.html">coconut oil</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Coconut_water%2C_unsweetened_42403010_nutritional_value.html?size=240+g">unsweetened coconut water</a>, and more.  Just don't go calling coconut sugar healthier than regular granulated sugar; you get kicked off the island for that.

<div id="chocolate" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Chocolate</font></i><br>
&emsp;Chocolate is basically <i>the</i> unhealthy food, being present in many junk foods like candy, cookies, brownies, and cake, and many other "healthier" foods like <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#granola">granola bars</a> and <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#muffins">muffins</a>.  Chocolate is very calorie dense; it's essentially a 50:50 ratio of cocoa powder and cocoa butter, meaing that a bar is about 50% fat.  Plus, add in that the vast majority of chocolate is loaded with sugar, and you begin to see why we have an obesity epidemic and a nation of chocoholics.
<br><br>
&emsp;Ironically though, true dark chocolate is actually a very healthy food.  Cocoa powder is one of the most <a href="/misc/iron">iron dense foods</a> out there, as well as being high in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, and riboflavin.  Dark chocolate is a rich source of antioxidants, which are anti-inflammatory and protect against free radicals.  Cocoa consumption has been shown to lower blood pressure, raise HDL, reduce your risk for heart disease, and improve brain function.
<br><br>
&emsp;Just because chocolate says that it's "dark" though doesn't automatically make it healthy; there's a reason why I also put dark chocolate on <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#chocolate">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a>.  Legally, anything over 43% cocoa solids can claim itself to be dark chocolate.  At minimum, you should aim to consume anything over 70%; anything less is candy.  The higher the percentage, the more cocoa and less sugar there is.  For 1 ounce (28 g) of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Baking_chocolate%2C_squares%2C_unsweetened_nutritional_value.html?size=1%20ounce%20%3D%2028.3495%20g">unsweetened (100%) chocolate</a>, you're looking at the following:
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Calories</b>: 182
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Fat</b>: 15 g (19 %)
<br>&emsp;<b>Sat Fat</b>: 9.2 g (46 %)
<br><b>Carbs</b>: 8.1 g (3 %)
<br>&emsp;<b>Fiber</b>: 4.7 g (17 %)
<br>&emsp;<b>Sugar</b>: 0.3 g

<div id="eggs" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Eggs</font></i><br>
&emsp;Ah eggs, the main reason for this list.  Just like with <a rel="" target="" href="#red-meat">red meat</a>, eggs get a bad rap for saturated fat and cholesterol.  Eggs are high in cholesterol, fairly high in fat, and somewhat lacking in protein for a food considered to a good source of it.  Although eggs are high in dietary cholesterol, this does not cause a rise in blood cholesterol in most people; they just share the same name (similar to dietary fat and bodily fat).  There is little relation between dietary cholesterol intake and heart disease; it's time to stop fearing the egg yolk.  In fact, whole eggs have been shown to raise HDL ("good" cholesterol).
<br><br>
&emsp;Eggs are basically nature's multi-vitamin.  While the egg white is essentially pure protein, the yolk is where all the goodies come from - protein, fat, and all the micronutrients.  Notably, eggs are one of the best sources of choline in your diet.  Choline is an essential, water-soluble nutrient that improves metabolism, liver function, heart health, muscle movement, nervous system, and brain development.  Eggs are also a rich source of lutein and zeaxanthin, which are antioxidants that are beneficial for eye health.  Eggs contain a notable amount of pretty much any vitamin or mineral you can think of, while also being a complete protein.  If any food is a superfood, it's the humble egg.
<br><br>
&emsp;Besides being a nutritional powerhouse, eggs are also very cheap and versatile.  My preferred balance for breakfast is 2 whole eggs and 2 servings of liquid egg whites with a bunch of veggies (like <a href="/recipes/spinach-mushroom-scrambled-eggs">Spinach & Mushroom Scrambled Eggs</a> and <a href="/recipes/higher-protein-scrambled-eggs">Higher Protein Scrambled Eggs</a>).  I get the extra protein boost from just the plain egg whites for less calories, while still having all the benefits of the whole eggs.  One <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Eggs%2C_egg_whole%2C_Large%2C_Grade_A_748967_nutritional_value.html?size=1%20egg%20%3D%2050.3%20g">large egg</a> (about 50 g) contains all the following:
<br>------------------------------------------
<br><b>Calories</b>: 74

<br><b>Fat</b>: 5 g (6 %)
<br>&emsp;<b>Sat Fat</b>: 1.6 g (8 %)

<br><b>Vitamin B12</b> <i>(Colbalamin)</i>: 0.51 mcg (21 %)

<div id="fish" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Fish</font></i><br>
&emsp;Fish is a great food group with a lot of variety.  Some fishes are higher in sodium and cholesterol I guess, but neither of which are really a concern if you have a balanced diet.  The only other downsides of fish I can think of are potential foodborne illnesses and the mercury content in some varieties.  But as long as you don't eat canned tuna more than twice a week, and you consume adequate amounts of selenium, there's no reason to fear fish.  Canned fish, like <a href="/recipes/massive-salad">tuna</a> and <a href="/recipes/brain-boosting-bowl">sardines</a>, is a cheap, healthy, and easy protein source that's always good to have on hand.
<br><br>
&emsp;As mentioned, there's many varieties of fishes.  Most white fish, like <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Fish%2C_raw%2C_Atlantic%2C_cod_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">cod</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Halibut%2C_raw_26118000_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">halibut</a>, and <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Fish%2C_raw%2C_tilapia_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">tilapia</a>, and pretty lean, making them good protein sources for less calories.  On the other hand, fatty fishes like <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Fish%2C_raw%2C_wild%2C_Atlantic%2C_salmon_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">salmon</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Canned_mackerel_by_DONG_WON_523236_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">mackerel</a>, and <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Sardines%2C_packed_in_water%2C_boneless%2C_skinless_26139190_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">sardines</a> are high in Omega-3 fats, which are essential, typically under consumed, and anti-inflammatory.
<br><br>
&emsp;Shellfish is fantastic as well, where a lot of them are lean protein sources that are nutrient dense: <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Raw_shrimp_564929_nutritional_value.html?size=100%20g">shrimp</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Mussels%2C_raw_26313100_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">mussels</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Clams%2C_canned_26303180_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">clams</a>, <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Mollusks%2C_raw%2C_mixed_species%2C_scallop_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">scallops</a>, and <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Mollusks%2C_raw%2C_common%2C_octopus_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">octopus</a> are all delicious and great for you.  <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Oysters%2C_raw_26315100_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">Oysters</a> in particular are extremely nutrient dense, having one of the highest <a href="/misc/iron">iron contents</a> of any food; even higher than <a rel="" target="" href="#red-meat">red meat</a>.
<br><br>
&emsp;I've listed many types of fish and shellfish above, but I've decided to go with salmon here, as it's typically considered one of the healthiest fishes you can eat.  Salmon is one of the best sources of Omega-3 fatty acids, and it's pink color comes from astaxanthin, a carotenoid that's beneficial for heart, eye, skin, and brain health.  Per 100 g of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Fish%2C_raw%2C_wild%2C_Atlantic%2C_salmon_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">raw wild salmon</a>:

<div id="milk" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Milk</font></i><br>
&emsp;How did milk, and dairy as a whole, so quickly go from being an everyday staple for everyone to a must avoid food group?  As long as you're not lactose-intolerant, I see no reason to avoid milk.  Dairy is a good source of complete protein, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and vitamin B12.  Calcium is crucial for bone health, and vitamin B12 plays a large role in brain function and energy levels.  
<br>
&emsp;Most dairy products are very cheap, versatile, tasty, and minimally processed.  Here are some great overlooked dairy products.  With all of these, always always always make sure to get plain, without any added sugars:
- Buttermilk
- Cottage cheese
- Greek yogurt
- Kefir
- Milk

&emsp;Milk also comes in varying fat contents, making it easy to get exactly what you're looking for.  All variants of milk (whole, 2%, 1%, and skim) are essentially the same nutritionally besides the fat and calories.  Below are the nutrition facts for 1 cup (244 g) of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Milk%2C_fat_free_%28skim%29_11113000_nutritional_value.html?size=1%20cup%20%3D%20244%20g">skim milk</a>:

<div id="nuts" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Nuts and Seeds</font></i><br>
&emsp;Assuming that you don't have a nut allergy, there's no reason to avoid eating nuts.  Yes, they are high in fat, meaning that they are high in calories.  But as long as you accurately measure out your nuts, there's no reason to not consume them.  <a href="/misc/fats">Fat</a> is not bad for you though; stop avoiding whole food sources of essential nutrients.
<br><br>
&emsp;While the sodium content is up to you (unsalted, lightly salted, or salted), always try to get dry roasted nuts whenever possible.  Dry roasted means that you're (hopefully) getting nothing but nuts and salt, with no added oils, sugars, flavors, or preservatives.  Most <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Planters-Dry-Roasted-Peanuts-16-oz/10291453?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1600&from=/search">commercially salted nuts</a> (even some that are dry roasted) have added sugar, corn syrup, maltodextrin, and flavors.  This, combined with being very easy to overeat, is why nuts were on my <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#nuts">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a> list as well.
<br><br>
&emsp;Nuts are one of the most nutrient dense food groups.  They're a great source of heart healthy mono-unsaturated fats, fiber, protein, copper, magnesium, and manganese.  Being high in fat and fiber, while low in carbs, nuts are great for balancing your blood sugar and feeling full.  Most nuts are very similar, but there are some differences, which is why it's good to have a variety.  Below are all great examples of nuts you should work into your diet and benefits of each of them:

&emsp;Similar to nuts, seeds are also great sources of healthy fats and essential micronutrients.  All of the same benefits apply, and some seeds, like chia and flax, are also great sources of Omega-3 fats.  Most seeds also contain less fat and more fiber, making them lower in calories.  Both nuts and seeds have been shown to aid in weight loss, improve type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and reduce risk of heart attack and stroke.  Here are some great seeds for you to eat:

&emsp;Many nuts and seeds are nutritionally similar, but all are healthy additions to your diet.  They're anti-inflammatory, benefit heart and brain health, contain anti-oxidants, and are very convenient.  Here, I've decided to go with <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Nuts%2C_almonds_nutritional_value.html?size=1+ounce+%3D+28.3495+g">almonds</a>, since they're one of the more well known nuts that people consume.

<div id="oats" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Oats</font></i><br>
&emsp;People definitely seem to have a mixed point of view on oats to say the least.  On the one hand, overnight oats were, and still are, a huge internet sensation for being an easy, cheap, and healthy breakfast.  Plus it seems that every youtube short and pintrest video for a healthy dessert uses oats as it's base.  On the other hand, some people make it their life mission to convince you that oatmeal is the worst food on the planet.  Let's find the middle ground here, shall we?
<br><br>
&emsp;I'll start with the downsides first, since they're shorter.  Oats are high in carbs, leading to a spike in blood sugar and feeling hungry way before lunch time.  Instant oatmeal packets are essentially the same as sugar-loaded <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#cereal">cereals</a>, just now warm.  When not homemade, oatmeal can easily sell the illusion of being a health food, when in reality it's actually a well marketed junk item.  Even if you prepare them yourself, it's very easy to add large amounts of sugar, honey, or maple syrup to them.  There's a reason why oatmeal landed it's way on my <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#oats">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a> list.
<br><br>
&emsp;The other main problem with oats comes from pesticides.  In the United States, oats are very commonly sprayed with glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup.  Long term exposure to glyphosate has been shown to lead to cancer, liver and kidney damage,  endocrine and reproductive issues, and respiratory and digestive problems.  Not something that you want to add up over your lifetime, even in amounts considered to be "safe".
<br><br>
&emsp;Glyphosate can be avoided though by buying the right oats.  I like these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Degree-Gluten-Sprouted-Rolled/dp/B08CRZCVFD">One Degree Rolled Oats</a>, which you can get at Costco for $10 for a 5 lb bag.  They're certified organic and gluten free, meaning that they contain no glyphosate and are totally safe for celiacs.  Plus, rolled oats (also known as old-fashioned) are lower on the glycemic index (53) compared to quick oats (71), since rolled oats are less processed.  I personally prefer the texture of rolled oats as well, but it's up to you.
<br><br>
&emsp;Being a complex carbohydrate source that's rich in fiber, manganese, selenium, and iron, oats are a great addition to your breakfast when paired with protein and fat.  Next time you make a bowl of oatmeal, add some protein in the form of greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and protein powder.  Make sure to get some healthy fats in there too, like chopped nuts or natural nut butter, chia seeds, and avocado.  Top it with bananas, berries, or cocoa powder, and you have a very nutritious breakfast.  Below are some of my oatmeal recipes that I rotate through frequently:
- <a href="/recipes/no-protein-powder-oatmeal">Overnight Oats with no Protein Powder</a>
- <a href="/recipes/strawberry-chia-oatmeal">Strawberry Chia Protein Oatmeal</a>
- <a href="/recipes/no-yogurt-oatmeal">Yogurt Free Protein Oats</a>
- <a href="/recipes/big-boi">Bigger Boi Oatmeal</a>
- <a href="/recipes/oats-banana">Banana Nut Bread Protein Overnight Oats</a>
- <a href="/recipes/vic-oats">Very Vic</a>
- <a href="/recipes/oats-pb">Peanut Butter Punch Protein Overnight Oats</a>
- <a href="/recipes/oats-berry">Berry Delicious Protein Overnight Oats</a>
- <a href="/recipes/oats-pumpkin">Pumpkin Pie Protein Overnight Oats</a>
- <a href="/recipes/oats-reeses">Reese's Protein Overnight Oats</a>

&emsp;The addition of fiber, protein, and fat from the other ingredients helps offset the blood sugar spikes from the carbs of the oats, while also helping you feel full for longer.  Plus, oats themselves are a good source of fiber, containing nearly 4 g in a 40 g serving.  Like <a rel="" target="" href="#brown-rice">rice</a>, oats may not be much on their own, but they can be a very nutritious base when paired with other ingredients.  A 1/2 cup (40 g) serving of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Cereals%2C_Dry%2C_Quick_Oats%2C_QUAKER_nutritional_value.html">oats</a> contains:

<div id="peanut-butter" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Peanut Butter</font></i><br>
&emsp;Peanut butter has pretty much all the same upsides and downsides as <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">nuts</a>.  But the reason it's on my <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#peanut-butter">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a> list is because <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Creamy-Peanut-Butter-16-oz/3716446909?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1200&from=/search">conventional no stir peanut butter</a> (like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Jif-Creamy-Peanut-Butter-16-Ounce-Jar/777839120?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Jif</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SKIPPY-Peanut-Butter-Creamy-Plastic-Jar-16-3-oz/37447687?classType=VARIANT&athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Skippy</a>) has hydroginated oils (vegetable oils and trans fats) and sugar.  It's pastey, overly sweet, and doesn't taste like peanuts.  If it doesn't pour out when turned upside-down, then it's not real peanut butter.
<br><br>
&emsp;Natural peanut butter on the other hand contains nothing but peanuts (or any other kind of nut) and salt.  It's more expensive to buy than no stir peanut butter, but good brands are <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SMUCKER-ORGANIC-NATURAL-PEANUT-BUTTER/10308151?classType=VARIANT&from=/search">Smucker's</a>, Trader Joe's, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Teddie-All-Natural-Super-Chunky-Peanut-Butter-36-oz/1218360798?classType=REGULAR&athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Teddie</a>.  I prefer to <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">make my own</a> though, as it's much cheaper and very simple to do.  Just process whole nuts for about 5-10 minutes until you have a smooth and luscious nut butter.
<br><br>
&emsp;I won't repeat what I said above about <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">nuts</a>, as everything would still apply here.  Nuts are nutrient powerhouses, but also high in fat.  For 2 tbsp (32 g) of <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Natural_peanut_butter_by_HAMPTON_FARMS_718824_nutritional_value.html?size=2%20tbsp%20%3D%2032.0%20g">natural peanut butter</a> (just peanuts and salt, no hydroginated oils or added sugars), we have the following:

<div id="popcorn" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Popcorn</font></i><br>
&emsp;Popcorn is <i>the</i> movie theater junk food.  It's often covered in fat (butter or hydroginated oils) and salt, and sometimes can be loaded with sugar and artificial flavors too (if it's flavored).  Even worse, microwave popcorn (the ones in the bags) is a well known source of PFAS chemicals, which are linked with cancer, immunie issues, thyroid disease, and obesity.
<br><br>
&emsp;But it's not all bad news; far from it.  Popcorn is similar to <a rel="" target="" href="#potatoes">potatoes</a>, in that the food itself is fairly unoffensive, but it become an inflammation bomb when the <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#popcorn">junk</a> gets added on.  Popcorn is a whole grain with a decent amount of fiber, protein, phosphorus, magnesium, and copper.
<br><br>
&emsp;<a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Popcorn%2C_unbuttered%2C_air-popped_54403010_nutritional_value.html?size=40+g">Plain popcorn kernels</a> are an insane volume food.  Just 3 tbsp (40 g) of unpopped kernels becomes 7.5 cups of cooked popcorn.  The high volume combined with the high fiber content leads popcorn to become a very filling and somewhat healthy snack if you prepare it yourself.  The nutrition facts are as follows:

<div id="potatoes" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Potatoes</font></i><br>
&emsp;Potatoes are often thought of as a junk food, and probably for good reason.  Similar to <a rel="" target="" href="#popcorn">popcorn</a>, the problem doesn't lie with the food itself, but what's been done to it.  Potatoes actually landed itself on my <a href="/misc/fake-healthy-foods#potatoes">'Healthy' Trap Foods</a> list, because they are often prepared in ways not beneficial to your health:
- French fries
- Mashed potatoes
- Hashbrowns
- Tater tots
- Home fries
- Twice baked potatoes
- Scalloped potatoes
- Loaded potato skins
- Potato salad
- Potato chips
- Potato rolls
- Gnocchi

&emsp;As long as you don't cover them in butter, stick them in a deep frier, or load on cheese, bacon, and sour cream, potatoes can be a very healthy addition to your diet.  Potatoes are the highest ranking food on the satiety index, meaning that they keep you full for longer than other foods when calories are controlled.  They're a starchy vegetable with a decent bit of fiber, contain more potassium than a banana, and are extremenly cheap and versatile.  Just make sure to consume the skin; that's where all the nutrients are.  For 1 medium <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Potatoes%2C_raw%2C_flesh_and_skin_nutritional_value.html?size=1+Potato+small+%281-3%2F4%22+to+2-1%2F2%22+dia%29+%3D+170+g">potato</a> (about 170 g), you're looking at:

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Overshadowed/potato.png" alt="" class="smaller-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Sweet potatoes are often thought of as a healthier potato.  Not only do they taste better (imo), but sweet potatoes are loaded with vitamin A, which is beneficial for eye and immune health.  Despite being higher in sugar (there's no need to avoid whole food sugars), sweet potatoes have a lower glycemic index (GI) value than regular potatoes: 70 compared to 85.  Again, make sure to eat the potato skins.  For 1 medium <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Sweet_potato%2C_unprepared%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html?size=170+g">sweet potato</a> (170 g):

<div id="red-meat" class="table-of-contents"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Red Meat</font></i><br>
&emsp;I've saved the most controversial for last (thank you alphabetical order).  The supposed downsides of red meat are similar to that of <a rel="" target="" href="#eggs">eggs</a>; that being saturated fat and dietary cholesterol.  Red meat has a similar saturated acid profile to eggs, and contains less cholesterol.  Just make sure to avoid fatty meats like 80% ground beef and rib-eye steaks, as well as processed meats like bacon, sausage, cold cuts, hot dogs, and pepperoni.
<br><br>
&emsp;As long as you consume lean meats, like 93% lean ground beef or lean steaks, there's no reason to avoid red meat.  In fact, there are many reasons why you should actually seek out red meat.  Besides the obvious (complete) protein, beef is a rich source of iron, selenium, zinc, niacin, vitamin B12, and choline.  Red meat contains heme-iron, the more bioavailable version, meaning that iron from beef is more easily absorbed in the body as opposed to plant based sources of iron.
<br><br>
&emsp;A lot of my <a href="/recipes/ground-meat">ground meat</a> recipes use turkey over beef since ground turkey is cheaper.  But 2-3 years of minimal beef consumption has caught up with me, and I have very low iron.  Beef has over double the iron of turkey, see <a href="/misc/iron">I Run on Iron</a>.  Here's all of the following per 100 grams of raw <a href="https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Beef%2C_raw%2C_93%25_lean_meat_%252F_7%25_fat%2C_ground_nutritional_value.html?size=100+g">93/7 ground beef</a>:
