<u><b><font size="+2">Description</font></b></u><br>
&emsp;Ground chicken is a great alternative to ground beef or ground turkey that I like to use on occasion.  I've used it in recipes before like my <a href="/recipes/chicken-nuggets">Freezer Chicken Nuggets</a>, <a href="/recipes/low-fodmap-tacos">Low FODMAP Chicken Tacos</a>, and <a href="/recipes/lemon-feta-bowl">Lemon Feta Chicken Bowls</a>.  You can really use ground chicken in place of any type of <a href="/recipes/ground-meat">ground meat</a> for slightly different flavor and nutrition.

&emsp;Chicken breasts are about 99% lean, and chicken thighs are about 93% lean.  Compared to beef and turkey (both 93%), chicken is a leaner option.  But ground chicken is always much more expensive.  I can get 93/7 ground beef for about $4.50 per pound and 93/7 ground turkey for about $4.00 per pound.  But ground chicken thighs and ground chicken breasts are normally about $4.50 per pound and $5.50 per pound, respectively.

&emsp;Today, I wanted to try saving some money and making my own ground chicken.  Since I can get boneless skinless chicken breasts for about $2.50 per pound (and thighs for about $3.00 per pound), I could save over half by just grinding it myself.  And it's very simple to do; let me show you.

<ol>
    <li>
        &emsp;Trim the fat off your chicken, and cut into 1" cubes.  Transfer to a cookie sheet.  Either chicken breasts or thighs will work here, but today I'm going with breasts.

    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
        &emsp;Freeze the food processor blade and the cookie sheet (uncovered) for 30 minutes.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
        &emsp;Pulse in a food processor (about 10 times of 1 second each) until you have a ground chicken consistency, about the size of a grain of rice.  Transfer to a bowl.  You may need to blend in batches depending on how much chicken you have; I did 3 for these 4 large breasts.

    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
        &emsp;At this point you have raw ground chicken!  Use any way you'd normally use any ground meat.  Here I'm just sauteing it in a pan until fully cooked, and adding in a can of fava beans, some <a href="/recipes/bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a>, and spices (chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, black pepper, and salt)
