Description: I think of a single person who doesn't like brownies. As with my <a href="/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies">Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies</a>, here's a standard dessert recipe, with butter, sugar, and white flour. I like to bake traditional desserts occasionally, and these are ones that you know everyone will love at a party. They're not healthy at all, unlike most things on this page, but that's okay; enjoy these in morderation
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and grease an 8" pan with oil. Make sure to coat it well; you don't want the brownies to stick to the pan<br><br>

- Melt your butter in the microwave. Combine together melted butter, oil, and sugar with a hand mixer until the sugar is very well incorporated, about a minute<br><br>

- You can replace the powdered sugar with granulated sugar, but remember to replace with 1:1 by weight, not volume. Replace 2 cups (240 g) of powdered sugar with 1.25 cups (240 g) granulated sugar<br><br>

- As for the oil, I'll be using extra virgin coconut oil here, but either extra virgin olive oil or canola oil will also work<br><br>

- Crack in the eggs, pour in the vanilla, and add the salt (omit the salt if using salted butter). Again, beat with your hand mixer until super smooth, about a minute<br><br>

- Add in the cocoa powder and flour, and stir until just combined with a silicone spatula. Do not over mix, or you'll develop the gluten in the flour and end up with cakey brownies. Optionally fold in some chocolate chips<br><br>

- Optional, but recommend if you have the patience - let the batter sit in the bowl (or pan) in the fridge overnight. This step further dissolves the sugar into the batter, leading to the glossy skin on top characteristic of boxed brownies. This step is really only necessary if you swap the powdered sugar for granulated sugar. The powdered sugar is much more fine, and as such will dissolve much more easily into the batter. Granulated sugar on the other hand will leave grainy sugar crystals in your raw batter, preventing brownie skin. Letting the sugar dissolve overnight breaks down these crystals, leading to a better brownie texture<br><br>

- Transfer your batter to the pan, and smooth out to all sides. Thump the pan a few times to remove any air bubbles<br><br>

- Bake at 350F for about 20-25 minutes. Just until the center of the brownies no longer jiggles and is set to the touch. A toothpick should come out slightly dirty. Too wet and the brownies are raw; clean and the brownies are overcooked. Timing will depend on your pan and oven, so start checking around 15 minutes<br><br>

- Allow the brownies to cool in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before slicing with a plastic knife
