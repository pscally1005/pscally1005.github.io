Description: Here's a standard chocolate chip cookie recipe. I usually only make and post healthy recipes, but it's okay to enjoy the classic treat from time to time. Chocolate chip cookies are usually what I make to bring for an occasion; that way I can have 1 or 2 every so often, and I can leave someone else with the rest.  I made these to celebrate Vic getting into UF for her Master's Degree.  Brownies are the other classic dessert, so check out my <a href="/recipes/brownies">Classic Fudgy Brownies</a>
Instructions: 
- Mix together sugar, honey, and (melted) butter with a hand mixer until fluffy. Beat in egg and mix in vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Fully combine, then mix in the flour. Fold in the chocolate chips<br><br>

- I typically use vanilla extract, but almond extract is also great in these cookies.  Or, consider using mint extract for mint chocolate chip cookies.  Mint is much stronger though; don't use any more than 1/2 tsp<br><br>

- Chill the dough in the fridge (at least 30 minutes) if using melted butter. This step is not necessary if butter is softened<br><br>

- Scoop the cookies, roll into balls, and place onto a parchment lined cookie sheet.  These will flatten and spread as they bake, so leave plenty of room in between.  Don't do more than 12 on a standard size cookie sheet<br><br>

- Bake for about 8-9 min at 350F, or until lightly golden brown on the bottom and the sides. Allow them to cool on the pan for a few minutes, until they can be safely scraped off with a spatula without breaking.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool<br><br>

- If you're like me and typically only have whole wheat flour handy (instead of white flour), use 215 g instead of 240 g (just under 2 cups), since whole wheat flour absorbs more water than all purpose<br><br>

- If you want to make the cookies gluten free, just replace the all purpose flour (2 cups, 240 g) with 1.5 cups (180 g) oat or millet flour, and 1/2 cup (60 g) cornstarch<br><br>

- You can make these into peanut butter chocolate chip cookies as wel.  Just add 1/2 cup (128 g) of melted peanut butter to the cookie dough along with the sugar and butter.  Additionally, cut the flour in half, from 2 cups (240 g) to 1 cup (120 g).  Bake as normal for about 9 minutes<br><br>

- Cutting the flour in half also applies to gluten free and whole wheat peanut butter cookies as well.  For GF, use 3/4 cup (90 g) oat or millet flour, and 1/4 cup (30 g) of cornstarch in place of the all purpose flour (1 cup, 120 g).  For whole wheat, use just under 2 cups (108 g) whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose
