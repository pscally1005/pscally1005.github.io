<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;I wanted to put together a list of foods that people consider to be healthy, but are really just either a product of good marketing or misinformation.  These foods are typically referred to "Trap Foods", or "Fake Healthy Foods", as they can lure customers into thinking they're making better decisions, when in realty these "healthy" alternatives can be just as bad, if not worse.

<div id="cereal"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Cereal</font></i><br>
&emsp;"Part of a complete breakfast" is what we were taught growing up.  That children need cereal, and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  That's a hell of a successful marketing campaign.  Cereal is probably one of the worst things you can eat in the morning; it's essentially just a bowl of added sugar.  Don't worry guys, it's fat free though (as if that's really helping it's case).

&emsp;It doesn't take a nutritionist to realize that Lucky Charms or Froot Loops are nothing more than a treat, but where the real "danger" lies is the cereals that are instead marketed as healthy.  I'm talking about things like Honey Nut Cheerios, Raisin Bran, and any of the other "boring" adult cereals that aren't "sugar bombs".  Except they are.  For a 1 cup (36 g) serving of <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/honey-nut-cheerios">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, you'll run yourself 12 g of added sugar and 140 calories, the exact same as in <a href="https://www.luckycharms.com/products/original-lucky-charms">Lucky Charms</a>.  Oh and that "can help lower cholesterol" claim, only <a href="https://www.cheerios.com/products/original-cheerios">Original Cheerios</a> actually have the American Heart Association certification on it.  And let's be honest, no one eats just 1 cup of cereal.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/cereal.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you're going to eat breakfast cereal, go with a sugar free option like plain cheerios or unsweetened puffed rice, and instead add flavors using fruit.  Original Cheerios only have 1 g of added sugar per serving, and the serving size is larger (1.5 cups as opposed to 1 cup).  Don't be fooled by that either!  Even then cereal still isn't the healthiest breakfast; it's still a bowl of empty refined carbs with no healthy fats or proteins, but at least this way it can actually be "part of a complete breakfast".  I've also had good success making my own cereal called <a href="/recipes/cinnamon-chickpea">Cinnamon Toast Chickpeas</a>, which are crispy chickpeas tossed with cinnamon, served over a protein shake, and topped with berries and nuts.  Now that's a complete breakfast!

&emsp;Don't know why I just came out swinging with a vendetta against General Mills, the rest will be toned down.  Probably because I've personally been duped by this in the past, and it's a very common trap food.  Look for cereals with no added sugars, whole grains, and high in fiber.  Anything else is junk food with a good marketing team.

<div id="oats"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Oatmeal</font></i><br>
&emsp;Okay so you've gotten past cereal, but surley oatmeal is safe right?  Think again.  Oats can be a great addition to your diet: they're a whole grain, high in fiber low fat, versatile, delicious, and gluten free.  They also contain a fair bit of manganese and iron, and are rich in antioxidants.  It even boasts about being "heart healthy" (so does cereal) on the box.  So what's the problem?

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/oatmeal.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;The main issue isn't with oatmeal, but how it's prepared.  I'm mainly talking about <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quaker-Instant-Oatmeal-Variety-Value-Pack-1-51-oz-20-Packets/45612375?athbdg=L1300&from=/search">flavored packets</a> of oatmeal here, like ones in the image above.  Unfortunately, these are really no different nutritionally from a bowl of sugary cereal; it's just warm now.  These packets are loaded with added sugars.  When it comes to oatmeal for breakfast, make it yourself from plain oats, and sweeten it with fruit and a small amount of maple syrup or honey if desired.  Also add some healthy fats like chopped nuts or nut butter, and some protein with yogurt or protein powder (or both!)

<center><img src="/assets/Food/Breakfast/No Pro/no-pro.jpg" alt="" class="instruction-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Below I'll list a bunch of oatmeal recipes which are all low in added sugar, packed with protein and fiber, have a good dose of healthy fats, and can be eaten warm or cold:<br>

<div id="granola"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Granola Bars</font></i><br>
&emsp;Oatmeal flows us nicely into granola bars.  Usually though of as a healthy boring snack, these are actually much worse than they seem.  Granola and granola bars are loaded with added sugars; just 1 Chewy Chocolate Chip Granola Bar has 7 g of added sugar in a 24 g serving.  Do you know what else has the same amount of added sugar?  2 Chips Ahoy cookies.  The vast majority of bars on the market contain sugar (or some type of sugar) as one of the first 3 ingredients on the label, making them a dessert.

&emsp;Don't think <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nature-Valley-Crunchy-Granola-Bars-Oats-n-Honey-12-Bars-8-94-OZ-6-Pouches/10311392?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Nature Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kellogg-s-Nutri-Grain-Apple-Cinnamon-Chewy-Soft-Baked-Breakfast-Bars-Ready-to-Eat-20-8-oz-16-Count/10818664?from=/search">Nutrigrain</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/KIND-Breakfast-Gluten-Free-Dark-Chocolate-Cocoa-Protein-Snack-Bars-1-76-oz-12-Count/1297275997?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Kind Bars,</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CLIF-BAR-White-Chocolate-Macadamia-Nut-Flavor-Made-with-Organic-Oats-9g-Protein-Non-GMO-Plant-Based-Energy-Bars-2-4-oz-10-Pack/5193278278?from=/search">Clif Bars</a> are any better.  I will say I used to be a huge fan of all 4 of these, and Clif Bars in particular serve a purpose.  On a long hike or after a hard workout, the simple sugars in Clif Bars are actually exactly what your body needs to replenish energy, and the protein aids in recovery.  Just don't eat them as a day to day snack.  If you want your own homemade granola or granola bars, you should check out my <a href="/recipes/granola">Low Sugar Granola</a> and my <a href="/recipes/granola-bars">Peanut Butter Banana Granola Bars</a>, which only use a minimal amount of sweetener, and no refined fats or oils.  Just nuts and oats!

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/bars-1.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you're going to get a bar, I'd recommend either <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Larabar-Blueberry-Muffin-Gluten-Free-Vegan-Fruit-Nut-Bars-6-ct/702968641?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Larabar</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/RXBAR-Variety-Pack-Chewy-Protein-Bars-Ready-to-Eat-Protein-Snack-10-Count/331912964?from=/search">RxBars</a>; both are made with dates and nuts, and contain no added sugar or artificial sweeteners.  RxBars even have some protein powder as well.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/bars-2.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
<div id="trail-mix"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Trail Mix</font></i><br>
&emsp;Trail mix is the next step from granola, where you essentially just remove the oats, and instead have a mix of nuts and candy.  <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">Nuts</a> are healthy, but can be overdone (see below).  But the main problem with trail mix is the chocolate chips or M&Ms.  Trail mix can be a great snack, especially when on a trail (duh), where the salt, fat, and sugar are great for when you're out exercising.

&emsp;But don't be fooled into thinking it's healthy just because it contains nuts, just like how granola isn't healthy just because it contains oats.  Look out for the <a rel="" target="" href="#chocolate">chocolate</a> and <a rel="" target="" href="#dried-fruit">dried fruit</a>.  A lot of trail mixes can contain a surprising amount of added sugar.  Plus, it's very high in fat and calories, so it's very easy to overeat.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/trail-mix.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you really love trail mix, you should consider making it yourself.  It's cheaper and healthier, as well as dead simple.  Just mix together nuts, dark chocolate, and unsweetened dried fruit in a bag, and you're done.  You can check out my <a href="/recipes/trail-mix">Mixed Nuts and Chocolate Trail Mix</a> for a easy typical trail mix, or my <a href="/recipes/air-fried-trail-mix">Air Fryer Trail Mix</a> for a roasted varation with nuts, bananas, and chickpeas.

<div id="nuts"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Nuts</font></i><br>
&emsp;Nuts, just like oats, can be a very healthful addition to your diet, or they can be the end of it, depending upon how they're prepared and consumed.  Nuts are rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, fiber, selenium, manganese, and contain a fair bit of protein.  They can also help in raising your HDL.  The problem is that nuts are insanely calorically dense (similar to <a rel="" target="" href="#chocolate">real dark chocolate</a>).  They're very high in fat, where just a 1 oz (28 g) serving contains about 160 calories.  Calories aren't everything, and fat is essential for you, but just don't overdo it on nuts (as I tend do to).

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/nuts.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Additionally, make sure to get plain nuts.  Ideally, your nuts are dry roasted; either unsalted or lightly salted are okay depending on your tastes and salt intake.  Just stay away from flavored nuts, like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Honey-Roasted-Peanuts-34-5-oz/10448380?from=/search">honey roasted peanuts</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Honey-Roast-Pecans-7oz/636142562?from=/search">candied pecans</a>.  These contain lots of added sugars, unhealthy oils, and unnecessary ingredients.  Even <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Dry-Roasted-Peanuts-16-oz/10448531?from=/search">regularly salted nuts</a> tend to contain a paragraph of ingredients.  Stick to just nuts and salt, and always weigh out your serving of nuts.  Any more than a handful of nuts is probably too much.

<div id="peanut-butter"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Peanut Butter</font></i><br>
&emsp;<a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">Natural nut butter</a> is the nectar of the gods.  Not only is it absolutely delicious, but it's very good for you.  Peanut butter has all the same downisdes as regular nuts though, but even worse, as it's even easier to over eat.  Just a large spoonful, or about 2 tbsp (32 g), of peanut butter contains 190 calories.  So while its packed with healthy fats and micronutrient, you need to be very mindful of your nut butter consumption, as the calories can add up very quick.  If you're eating peanut butter with your apple, you'll probably end up consuming twice as many caloreis from peanut butter than from the apple itself.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/pb.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
&emsp;However, overconsumption isn't even the main problem with peanut butter.  The problem is the fake "no stir" peanut butter, that also contain hydroginated oils and sugar.  This peanut spread is cheaper than even buying your own peanuts and grinding them yourself, just fueling the problem (remember: sugar and palm oil are very cheap).  Just like with regular nuts, make sure to only buy peanut butter (or any nut butter) that is labeled as natural, and contains only nuts and salt.  My favorite brands (when I don't make it myself) are <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Teddie-All-Natural-Smooth-Peanut-Butter-36-oz/640652420?from=/search">Teddie</a> and Trader Joe's.  Stay away from any flavored nut butters, especially...

<div id="nutella"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Nutella</font></i><br>
&emsp;...nutella.  Nutella has a lot of nerve to call itself hazelnut spread, considering its just a sugar and fat spread.  A jar of nutella is 58% sugar and 30% palm oil; only just 13% of the jar contains actual hazelnuts.  Nutella is way more of a jelly substitute than a peanut butter one.  A 2 tbsp (37 g) serving contains a whopping 200 calories and 18 g of added sugar; that's 5 teaspoons!.  You know what contains 17 g of added sugar in the same serving size?  That's right, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Betty-Crocker-Rich-Creamy-Milk-Chocolate-Frosting-Gluten-Free-Frosting-16-oz/10311570?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Chocolate Frosting</a>, and the frosting is actually lower in fat and calories. And you and me both know we're going to eat more than just 1 serving.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/nutella.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;If you love nutella, then consider making it yourself, where you can control the sweetness, and totally eliminated the hydroginated oils.  I have a recipe for <a href="/recipes/nutella">Roasted Hazelnut Nutella</a> that's free of added sugars and oils.  Just roast and blend hazelnuts into a smooth nut butter, and add in some chocolate and bananas for sweetness.  Tastes way better than the jar, and isn't a total sugar bomb.

<div id="jelly"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Jelly and Jam</font></i><br>
&emsp;I love a good PB&J.  Which means using a good <a rel="" target="" href="#peanut-butter">peanut butter</a>, jelly, and <a rel="" target="" href="#bread">bread</a>.  Here, we're tackling jelly and jam though.  A jam is ideally just simmered fruit that's mildly sweetened, just like my <a href="/recipes/berry-jam">Low Sugar Berry Jam</a> or <a href="/recipes/strawberry-chia-jam">Strawberry Chia Jam</a>.  The problem is that most jellies and jams are just sugar spreads.  A 1 tbsp (20 g) serving of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Concord-Grape-Jelly-18-Ounces/10321567?from=/search">Smuckers Grape Jelly</a> contains 12 g of sugar.  That's 60% sugar (about the same as <a rel="" target="" href="#nutella">nutella</a>), and with none of the fiber from the whole fruit.  Even jellies that claim to be healthy, look out for the total sugar content, not just the added sugar content.  Unfortunately, fruit juice isn't considered added sugar on the label, but it's just concentrated fruit sugar, not the whole fruit.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/jam.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Outside of making your own jam, your best bets are any low sugar jam or jelly, with less than 4-5 g of added sugar per serving.  Trader Joe's has some good low sugar jellies, jams, and preserves.  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Good-Good-Keto-Friendly-Sweet-Strawberry-Jam-12-oz-1-Count/212702301?from=/search">Good Good</a> is also a good stevia sweetened jam brand, and this <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Low-Sugar-Reduced-Sugar-Strawberry-Preserves-15-5-Ounces/10308118?from=/search">Smuckers Low Sugar Strawberry Preserves</a> is a decent option.  Just stay away from any jellies labeled as "Sugar free" (like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Smucker-s-Sugar-Free-Concord-Grape-Jam-with-Splenda-Brand-Sweetener-12-75-Ounces/10308139?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">this one</a>), as those are sweetened with <a rel="" target="" href="#sugar-substitutes">sucralose</a> and taste disgusting.

<div id="dried-fruit"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Dried Fruit</font></i><br>
&emsp;Dried fruit is a bit of a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it's just fruit with the water removed, leaving a concentrated source of minerals but natural sugars.  On the other hand, some dried fruits are pumped full of added sugars.  Generally, raisins, dates, figs, and unsweetened freeze fried fruit crisps are pretty good, as all the sugar in these are just from the fruit itself.  Dried apricots and plums also tend to be unsweetened; just look out for the ingredients list.  Even though, you should be mindful of your dried fruit consumption, as it's very easy to overeat without all the water from the whole fruit.  Think about how many raisins you can eat in a handful, versus how many grapes you would eat in 1 bite.  Just like with nuts, dried fruit can be a healthy addition to your diet as long as your mindful of how much you're eating.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/cranberry.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;The bigger problem though comes from dried fruits with added sugars.  Dried cranberries, or crasins, are easily the worst offenders here.  Have you ever had a fresh cranberry?  They're insanely tart (which is apparently how fruit used to taste before we selectively bred them to be sweeter).  Compare that to dried cranberries though.  Dried cranberries are entirely added sugar.  You wouldn't think of putting Sour Patch Kids on your salad.  Raisins are nature's candy, but craisins are just candy for adults.  Just a 1/3 cup (40 g) serving contains a whopping 26 g of added sugar!  That's already over the American Heart Association's (AHA) daily guidelines for added sugar consumption for women.  Other sweetened dried fruits to be cautious of include blueberries, mangos and cherries.

<div id="juice"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Fruit Juice</font></i><br>
&emsp;So <a rel="" target="" href="#dried-fruit">dried fruit</a> is a highly concentrated source of sugar, even natural, that you should be mindful of consuming.  But what if we now removed all the fiber?  That's fruit juice.  In reality, a glass of fruit juice, even 100% without any added sugar, is only marginally better for you than a glass of soda.  You'll get some Vitamin C, but that's really about it.  You wouldn't give your child a Coke with breakfast, so why a glass of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simply-Non-GMO-Orange-Juice-No-Pulp-52-fl-oz-Bottle/959033640?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">orange juice</a> (I'll tell you: really good marketing).  Just eat the whole fruit.  At the end of your day, all fructose is the same to your liver, so without fiber to slow it's absorption, it really doesn't matter what the source is, even if it any isn't technically added.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/oj.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
<div id="smoothie"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Smoothies</font></i><br>
&emsp;So if <a rel="" target="" href="#dried-fruit">dried fruit</a> is a maybe and <a rel="" target="" href="#juice">fruit juice</a> is a hard no, then where do smoothies fall then?  Well about somewhere in the middle.  Smoothies are made with whole fruit, and thus do contain more fiber than fruit juice.  However, the process of blending fruit destroys some of it's fiber.  A smoothie can still be healthy however.  Just make sure to add some protein and fat to slow down the spike to your blood sugar.  I prefer using protein powder, greek yogurt, and chia seeds for a <a href="/recipes/smoothie">Protein Fruit Smoothie</a> if I do have one, but peanut or almond butter also work as great fat sources.  The healthiest smoothies also include some vegetables like spinach as well.

<center><img src="/assets/Food/Drinks/Smoothie/smoothie-cover.jpg" alt="" class="instruction-image"></center><br>
&emsp;And of course, only use an unsweetened liquid for your smoothies, like milk, unsweetened plant milks, or water.  Fruit is already plenty sweet without the addition of added sugars from the milk or any additional honey.  Smoothies are great to make yourself, but be very weary of ordering one anywhere, since you don't know how much added sugar is secretly in that glass.

<div id="sports-drinks"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Sports Drinks</font></i><br>
&emsp;Sports drinks, when used as they are intended, can be exactly what your body needs.  One medium 12 oz bottle of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gatorade-Thirst-Quencher-Fruit-Punch-Sports-Drinks-12-fl-oz-12-Count-Bottles/10449240?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Gatorade</a> contains 21 g of added sugar and 160 mg of sodium.  Which after a really strenuous activity, like a marathon, is exactly what you need.  The simple sugars replenish your glycogen stores in your liver, and sodium is an essential nutrient that is lost through sweating.  If you're sweating a ton, sick, or hungover, a Gatorade can be a lifesaver.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/gatorade.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Or it can be a noncarbinated salt soda if you're consuming it incorrectly.  The fact of the matter is that most Americans are not exercising enough, and consuming way too much ultraprocessed foods.  That means a high consumption of added sugar and salt, without any way of your body to use it.  So another addition source of the 2 is way more likely to do harm than good.  Save sports drinks for after intense physical activity, and not after a kid's leisurely soccer game or as a sipping drink throughout the day.  Give little Jimmy an orange instead.

<div id="energy-drinks"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Energy Drinks</font></i><br>
&emsp;What if you take a sports drinks, remove some of the salt, and instead add a ton of caffeine and some B vitamins?  You end up with a Red Bull.  Surprisingly, most energy drinks actually come packed with vitamins and minerals, with concentrations as much as a multivitamin.  They also contain a ton of added sugar (go figure) and caffeine (which isn't necessarily good or bad, just something to be mindful of).  

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/energy-drink.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;I found this image under the listing for <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Red-Bull-Energy-Drink-8-4-fl-oz-Pack-of-12-Cans/10316267?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Red Bull</a> on Walmart, where they out themselves as being worse for you than a typical soda or fruit juice.  Thankfully there are some brands of energy drinks that don't have any added sugar like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CELSIUS-Sparkling-Vibe-Variety-Pack-Functional-Essential-Energy-Drink-12-fl-oz-Pack-of-12/584986458?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Celsius</a>, but that doesn't make them healthy, just less bad.  Energy drinks aren't bad if you got a particularly terrible night's sleep, need to pull the (occasional) all nighter, or if you're out partying.  Just dont rely on them; I see people drinking these all the time at the office or the gym.

<div id="coffee"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Coffee</font></i><br>
&emsp;As I mentioned above with <a rel="" target="" href="#energy-drinks">energy drinks</a>, caffeine isn't inherently good or bad.  It can absolutely be a substance of toxic abuse, or it can help improve alertness and brain function.  For clarity, I'll say that I don't consume coffee or any caffeine.  I've just never drank it, so my body has never developed a dependency for it like most people.  There are studies showing the benefits of caffeine in moderation however; every coin has 2 sides.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/coffee.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
&emsp;So why is coffee on this list then?  Added fat and sugar.  <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/menu/product/873068728/iced/nutrition">Starbucks Peppermint White Chocolate Mocha Frappuccino</a> contains a tooth shattering and diabetes inducing 73 g of added sugar, as well as 470 calories and 17 g of fat.  That's almost 10 g more sugar and double the calories of a 16.9 fl oz <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mountain-Dew-The-Original-Soda-Pop-16-9-fl-oz-6-Pack-Bottles/16785022?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Mountain Dew</a>.  One of these every morning along with a <a rel="" target="" href="#muffins">muffin</a> is a one way ticket to metabolic syndrome.  Only black coffee contains any benefits; this is just a caffeinated milkshake.

<div id="iced-tea"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Iced Tea</font></i><br>
&emsp;I think most people can agree that while tea is healthy, there's no health benefits of a Snapple or Arnold Palmer iced tea.  The issue comes from the iced teas that are marketed as being "healthy", with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Pure-Leaf-Raspberry-Real-Brewed-Iced-Tea-Bottled-Tea-Drink-16-9-oz-6-Bottles/217654271?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Pure Leaf</a> being the main brand.  For a 16.9 fl oz serving of Pure Leaf, there's 42 g of added sugar, or 2.5 g per fl oz.  Just a single bottle contains over 1.5x your daily added sugar maximum.  The nutrition facts for the Pure Leaf are on the left below.  

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/iced-tea.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
&emsp;Compare that to this <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Sweet-Brewed-Iced-Tea-128-fl-oz-Bottle/10899050?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Great Value Iced Tea</a> (on the right in the above image).  This store brand iced tea has 30 g of added sugar in a 12 fl oz serving, or 2.5 g of sugar per fl oz.  Hey look at that; it's the exact same amounts of added sugar!  Don't be a fool to marketing.

<div id="diet-soda"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Diet Soda</font></i><br>
&emsp;So no sugar = healthy, right?  Not quite.  While the issue of artificial sweeteners is a highly contested topic, it is generally agreed that artificial sweeteners, and by extension diet coke, are less bad than their full sugar counterparts.  Less bad, but that doesn't mean good.  Diet soda is good if you addicted to regular soda, and are trying to wean yourself off.  In the same way that vaping could be helpful as a way to quit cigarettes.  That doesn't mean you should take up vaping, and the same holds true for a Diet Coke.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/diet-soda.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
<div id="milk"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Milk</font></i><br>
&emsp;Ah, the humble milk.  Whether you get whole milk, low fat, or skim, milk can be a nutrition option.  It's a complete protein, the fat helps with feeling satiated, and of course is a good source of calcium.  Milk isn't on this list because of it's fat content.  I think we know by now that fat is very good for you when not overconsumed; we don't live in the low fat craze of the 90s anymore.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/milk.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;The issue is again, added sugars (are you seeing a pattern?), and this plagues both milk and milk adjacent products.  Firstly, let's look at chocolate milk and strawberry milk.  A 14 fl oz bottle of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nestle-Nesquik-Chocolate-Lowfat-Milk-Ready-to-Drink-14-fl-oz-Bottle/24100302?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Chocolate Milk</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nestle-Nesquik-Strawberry-Low-Fat-Milk-Ready-to-Drink-14-fl-oz-Bottle/24414358?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Strawberry Milk</a> contain 39 g of sugar, 18 g of which are added.  But they're made with low fat milk, so people were duped into thinking these were helathy ways to give their kids calcium.  Oh, and strawberry milk doesn't contain any strawberry.  Go figure.

&emsp;The other main issue with milk is it's non-dairy counterparts.  I'm talking about almond, oat, soy, pea, cashew, and any other type of plant milk you can think of.  I'll be fully transparant and say that I keep almond milk in my fridge instead of cow's milk, mainly because it lasts way longer in the fridge (a few months instead of just a week).  I hardly ever drink milk too; normally it gets used a little at a time in my oatmeal or something.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/almond-milk.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;As long as you purchsae an unsweetened variety, you should be relatively okay.  Most plant based milk do contain other gums and weird ingredient, so as an almond milk purchaser, I will say that cow's milk is almost always the better choice (assuming you can digest it).  Sweetened plant based milk can have 12 g of added sugar in just a cup, as is the case with this <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Almond-Breeze-Vanilla-Almond-Milk-64-oz-Bottle/11961012?from=/search">Sweetened Vanilla Almond Milk</a>.  I always stick to either <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Almond-Breeze-Unsweetened-Original-Almondmilk-Refrigerated-64-oz/23658427?from=/search">Unsweetened Original Almond Milk</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Almond-Breeze-Unsweetened-Vanilla-Almond-Milk-Refrigerated-64-oz/12443612?from=/search">Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk</a>, or occasionally I'll make my own <a href="/recipes/oat-milk">Homemade Plant Based Milk</a> using either oats or peanuts for a cheaper option. 

&emsp;I'll be honest and say that in high school, I never used to understand why my mom would get mad at me for buying vanilla almond milk instead of unsweetened vanilla almond milk, but we all grow up and learn from our mistakes.  Be willing to change, and keep an open milk (I mean mind).

<div id="yogurt"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Yogurt</font></i><br>
&emsp;Yogurt, just like <a rel="" target="" href="#milk">milk</a> has the same deceptions.  It offers low fat "healthier" varieties that are pumped full of added sugar, and are way worse for you than their original full fat counterparts.  Just like with milk, the low or no fat options can also be healthy, as long as they are plain.  For me, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Greek-Plain-Nonfat-Yogurt-32-oz-Tub/26559565?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt</a> is the king of all dairy products.  Just 1 serving (2/3 cup, 170 g) contains 17 g of protein, no fat, no added sugar, and just 100 calories.  Greek yogurt is also a fantastic source of both calcium and vitamin B12, where 1 serving has 15% and 53% of your daily value, respectively.  I opt for the nonfat version, as I don't taste a difference between that and the full fat variety, so I'll instead get my fat from other sources, like <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">nuts</a>, chia seeds, or natural <a rel="" target="" href="#peanut-butter">nut butter</a>.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/yogurt.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Things start to get worse when you look at flavored yogurt, where <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Greek-Vanilla-Nonfat-Yogurt-32-oz-Tub-Plastic-Container/26559602?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Vanilla Nonfat Greek Yogurt</a> contains 13 g of added sugar (remeber, that's up from 0 g), and less protein (14 g instead of 17 g).  Don't be fooled by the fruit flavors either, even the ones with fruit chunks in them.  These contain just as much added sugar as the vanilla, if not more.  I used to eat the single serving fruit cup yogurts (like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Chobani-Hero-Batch-Vanilla-Greek-Yogurt-with-Mixed-Berry-on-the-Bottom-5-3-oz-4-Count-Plastic/519060542?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">this one</a>) every day in high school, until it started to hurt my teeth to eat it.  Only then did I flip it over and notice how much sugar was loaded into these small "healthy" cups.  Stick to plain, and add your own fruit and additional sweetner if desired.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/vanilla-yogurt.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Leaving the realm of Greek yogurt and going to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Original-Vanilla-Lowfat-Yogurt-32-oz/10450127?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt</a>, the added sugar content increases yet again to 16 g, and the protein content is slashed down to just 5 g now.  <a href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/original-single-serve-key-lime-pie">Yopait Key Lime Pie Yogurt</a> was my favorite in elementary and middle school, and unforunately it does not fare any better.  At the bottom of the barrel is <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Go-GURT-SpongeBob-SquarePants-Kids-Fat-Free-Yogurt-Variety-Pack-2-oz-Yogurt-Tubes-16-Ct/138914564?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Go-GURT</a>, but I don't think anyone thinks this junk could be healthy right?

<div id="pretzels"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Pretzels</font></i><br>
&emsp;Let's leave the world of dairy and move on to snack foods.  First on the chopping block: pretzels.  I'll just come out and say it: I was the weird kid who liked getting pretzel on Halloween (everything is probably starting to add up now).  I've always like fresh baked desserts, but I've never been a fan of packages cookies or candy; they're just too sweet with no flavor.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/pretzels.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Backstory aside, let's get back to pretzels.  Pretzels are though of as a healthier snack for some reason; I'm guessing because they're savory instead of sweet.  So added sugar isn't an issue for once; these <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Mini-Pretzel-Twists-16-oz/890488670?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Great Value Pretzels</a> contain virtually none.  The problem is that they're not much more than an ultraprocessed white flour snack with a ton of salt. The enriched flour is stripped of all it's fiber and micronutrients, leaving just starch and empty calories.  At least they're low in fat though, unlike <a rel="" targer="" href="#crackers">crackers</a> and <a rel="" targer="" href="#chips">chips</a>.  I'll be honest, I still love pretzels to this day, but they're still a treat I enjoy in moderation.

<div id="crackers"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Crackers</font></i><br>
&emsp;Crackers we easily my go to snack growing up.  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/RITZ-Fresh-Stacks-Original-Crackers-Family-Size-17-8-oz/52234929?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Ritz</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cinnamon-Graham-Crackers-14-4-oz/10315533?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Graham Crackers</a>, you name it.  I even have a recipe for <a href="/recipes/gf-crackers">Gluten Free Crackers</a>, that are basically mini healthy graham crackers.  I used to have an obsession with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wheat-Thins-Original-Whole-Grain-Wheat-Crackers-Family-Size-14-oz/810836571?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Wheat Thins</a>, where in college my friend shipped me 18 boxes for my birthday (thanks Sean, I would eat them every day when I woke up just before running).

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/crackers.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Crackers have the same issue as pretzels though.  While being low in sugar, they can just be empty starch calories from refined white flour.  Some crackers are also noticeably in both fat (think "butter" crackers like Ritz), or sugar (sweet graham crackers).  A serving of Ritz is a measly 5 crackers, with 4.5 g of fat and 3 g of sugar.  Graham crackers aren't any better, where a serving (2 full cracker sheets) has 3.5 g of fat and 8 g of added sugar.  My precious wheat things are actually high in both, where just a 16 cracker serving has 5 g of fat (from canola oil) and 5 g of sugar.  These don't sound terrible, but you and I will certainly be eating more than just 1 serving if we're not paying attention.

<div id="chips"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Chips</font></i><br>
&emsp;I think everyone can agree that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lay-s-Classic-Potato-Chips-Snack-Chips-8-oz/33282303?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Lay's Potato Chips</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Doritos-Nacho-Cheese-Tortilla-Snack-Chips-Party-Size-14-5-oz-Bag/433078517?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Doritos</a> aren't healthy.  In fact, they're probably the default junk food snack that people think of, up there with cookies and candy.  There are lots of different types of chips though, with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tostitos-Scoops-Tortilla-Chips-Party-Size-14-5-oz-Bag/11027423?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">tortilla chips</a> being the other main variety.  Most would probably also agree that tortilla chips are junk food, so I'm not gonna spend any time here.  Any type of chip is going to be relatively low in sugar, but very high in fat and salt.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/chips.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;There are variations of chips that are marketed as being healthy though.  These include veggie straws, plantain chips, and banana chips.  Starting with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Sensible-Portions-Gluten-Free-Sea-Salt-Garden-Veggie-Wavy-Chips-7-oz-Bag/20369844?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Veggie Straws</a>, these are just potato shapes in a different shape, with a tiny bit of dehydrated vegetable.  They're basically the potato chip version of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Barilla-Classic-Non-GMO-Kosher-Certified-Tri-Color-Rotini-Pasta-12-oz/10309200?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Tri-Color Rotini Pasta</a>; just a fun different color, no more, no less.  

&emsp;Next up is <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Goya-Plantain-Chips-5-oz/49642283?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Plantain Chips</a>.  Instead of deepfrying potatoes to make potato chips, these are just deepfried plantains.  It's a starchy vegetable (good) fried in vegetable oil (bad).  Both <a rel="" targer="" href="#potatoes">potatoes</a> and plantains are healthy on their own, but can be turned into junk food when prepared like so.  Now replace the plantians with bananas, add a little bit of sugar, and you end up with <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Sweetened-Banana-Chips-12-oz/35192848?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">banana chips</a>.  These tend to use coconut oil at least, but that's a mild improvement.  If you can, make them yourself, or just eat the whole fruit/vegetable.

<div id="popcorn"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Popcorn</font></i><br>
&emsp;This one might actually be the opposite of the others on this list.  Most people would associate popcorn with being junk food, eaten with a ton of butter alongside a candy at the movies.  But popcorn can actually be a relatively healthy snack with a lot of volume if prepared correctly.  Just 3 tbsp (40 g) of unpopped kernels turns into a whopping 7.5 cups when cooked.  I've never been a personal fan of popcorn (it always gets stuck in my teeth), but I've heard that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Orville-Redenbacher-s-Original-Gourmet-Yellow-Popcorn-Kernels-45-oz/10312395?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">plain popcorn</a> with some nutritional yeast or other spices can make for a very satisfying snack.  Yes it's essentially all carbs with a mediocre amount of fiber and protein, but a full serving actually looks like a lot of food since it's mostly air.  Just make sure to get plain popcorn kernels like the one linked above and shown below.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/popcorn.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Just stay away from the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Extra-Butter-Flavored-Microwave-Popcorn-2-55-oz-12-Count/812120929?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">microwaveable bags of popcorn</a>.  These have a lot of salt, fat (palm oil), and preservatives.  Additionally, the packaging for microwave popcorn contains PFAS, or forever chemicals, which are linked to many negative health outcomes including cancer and lung problems.

<div id="diets"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Keto, Vegan, Gluten Free, and Organic Snacks</font></i><br>
&emsp;Despite being very different, most diets work for weight loss and better overall health because they have one main thing in common: limiting your consumption of ultraprocessed junk and focusing on real whole foods.  Which is great, until the diet becomes trendy, and companies capatalize on this.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/keto.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;First up is keto.  For those living under a rock, a ketogenic, or keto diet is extremely low carb and high fat.  This means a lot of oil, butter, nuts, and fatty fish (ooh sounds good), and no high carb foods like bread, rice, pasta, or even beans (whelp nevermind).  Keto is the hot and trendy diet right now, with snacks such as <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/HighKey-Sugar-Free-Cookie-Low-Carb-Keto-Snack-Gluten-Free-Chocolate-Chip-3oz/771869727?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">cookies</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Duncan-Hines-Keto-Friendly-Chewy-Fudge-Brownie-Mix-10-oz/433466256?from=/search">brownie mix</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Atkins-Protein-Chips-Keto-Friendly-Baked-Not-Fried-Ranch-1-1oz/541867558?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">chips</a>, and more hitting the store shelves.  These are similar to their original counterparts, with just all the carbs removed.  Mainly, they use stevia or erythritol instead of sugar, and almond flour instead of wheat or corn.  While maybe being margianlly healthier, these snacks are still ultraprocessed, containing a laundry list of ingredients, with a lot of hydroginated oils, salt, and preservatives.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/vegan.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Many people you have the false notion that vegan = healthy.  But you can be very unhealthy on a vegan diet, or very healthy on an omnivorous diet.  Not eating animal products does not directly correlate to better health; eating more whole foods does (which vegans tend to do, so that's a plus).  You know what else is vegan though: <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Oreo-Chocolate-Sandwich-Cookies-Party-Size-24-16-oz/5035879686?from=/search">Oreo's</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Coca-Cola-Classic-Soda-Pop-16-9-fl-oz-Bottles-6-Pack/10535170?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Coca-Cola</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SOUR-PATCH-KIDS-Original-Soft-Chewy-Candy-Share-Size-12-oz/580621266?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Sour Patch Kids</a>.  I think you get my point.  Even the supposedly healthier snacks (like these <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nature-s-Bakery-Oatmeal-Crumble-Strawberry-Breakfast-Snack-Bars-1-41-oz-10-Count/338684992?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Nature's Bakery</a> bars) are just expensive and fancy looking versions of the original products, and are at best only marginally better for you.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/gf.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;At least (most) people have a good reason for following a strict gluten free diet, with that being Celiac disease.  Gluten comes from grains such as barley, rye, and of course wheat.  It would be assumed then that a gluten free diet would be healthier then, omitting all sources of flour, thus eliminating any ultraprocessed "foods" containing it.  But there's still plenty of junk food that's naturally gluten free (pretty much all <a rel="" target="" href="#chips">chips</a> are), and some specifically made to be gluten free.  You can still get gluten free cookies like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/OREO-Gluten-Free-Chocolate-Sandwich-Cookies-Gluten-Free-Cookies-12-08-oz/1537120639?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Oreo's</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Tate-s-Bake-Shop-Gluten-Free-Chocolate-Chip-Cookies-Gluten-Free-Cookies-7-oz/36310776?athbdg=L1300&from=/search">Tate's</a>.  Fine treats to have on occasion (everything in moderation, remember), but don't fool yourself into thinking it's healthier because it contains no gluten.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/organic.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Finally, and probably worst of all, we have organic.  Why is organic the worst?  Because it's the most ambiguous.  All the other categories above (keto, vegan, and gluten free) have hard set criteria for what is and isn't allowed.  Organic though: can anyone actually define what that means?  Why do <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simply-Doritos-Organic-White-Cheddar-Tortilla-Chips-7-5-oz-Bag/165522395?from=/search">Doritos</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simply-Tostitos-Organic-Blue-Corn-Tortilla-Chips-8-25-oz-Bag/49909674?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Tostitos</a> make organic chips?  What are you really doing here lmao.

<div id="protein"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Protein Bars and Snacks</font></i><br>
&emsp;As I said in my <a href="/recipes/protein-bar">100 Calorie Protein Bars</a>, a protein bar needs to have at least 10 g of protein per 100 calories, and have no added sugar.  Otherwise, it's not a protein bar.  I love <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/RXBAR-Variety-Pack-Chewy-Protein-Bars-Ready-to-Eat-Protein-Snack-10-Count/331912964?from=/search">RxBars</a>, but I wouldn't consider them a protein bar (not even my own <a href="/recipes/rx-bars">Copycat Chocolat RX Bars</a>).  They're still a healthy snack certainly, with good doses of healthy fats (nuts), natural sugars (dates), fiber (dates and nuts), and protein (egg white protien powder).  I'm ripping on RxBars here, but only because they're probably the <i>best</i> protein bars on the market; it pretty much just gets worse from here.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/protein.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Most other protein bars and snacks on the market contain vegetable oils, added sugars, and a slew of other weird ingredients.  They also have very high contents of other macro nutrients; I want a protien bar, not a fat bar or a carb bar.  Protein bars can be a great lean snack, and I can always add more fat (peanut butter) or carbs (banana) along side it.  Just because it has the word "protein" on it doesn't mean it's healthy, or necessarily even high in protein.  Some examples are <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Chewy-Protein-Bar-Peanut-Butter-Dark-Chocolate-10g-Protein-5-Ct/26572609?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Great Value</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/TRUBAR-Oh-Oh-Cookie-Dough-12CT-Indulgent-Nutrition-Healthy-on-the-Go-Snack-Bars-Plant-Based-Protein-Vegan-Gluten-Free/1873534436?from=/search">TruBar</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nature-Valley-Protein-Granola-Bars-Snack-Variety-Pack-Chewy-Bars-15-ct-21-3-OZ/274787674?from=/search">Nature Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gatorade-Peanut-Butter-Chocolate-Whey-Protein-Bars-20g-Protein-6-Pack/558471204?from=/search">Gatorade</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/CLIF-BAR-Chocolate-Chip-Made-with-Organic-Oats-10g-Protein-Non-GMO-Plant-Based-Energy-Bars-2-4-oz-5-Pack/5195244229?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Clif Bar</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/KIND-Protein-Gluten-Free-Dark-Chocolate-Nut-Snack-Bars-1-76-oz-5-Count/257609957?from=/search">Kind</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kellogg-s-Special-K-Strawberry-Chewy-Protein-Meal-Bars-Ready-to-Eat-12g-Protein-Snacks-12-Count/23597988?from=/search">Kellogg's</a>.  All of these protein bars fail to hit those requires, with low protein contents and added sugar ranging between 5 g and 24 g per bar.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/protein-cookie.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;It's not just bar; other protein snacks are just as guilty.  If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  The following examples either come close or actually meet the protein bar requirements, but they're still ultraprocessed snacks to enjoy in moderation; not a building block of your daily diet.  I'm talking about protein <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quest-Protein-Cookie-High-Protein-Chocolate-Chip-4-Count/554117134?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">cookies</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quest-Tortilla-Style-Protein-Chips-Baked-19g-of-Protein-Loaded-Taco-1-1oz/207374879?athbdg=L1103&from=/search">chips</a>, and <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Legendary-Foods-Protein-Pastry-Strawberry-2-2oz-Gluten-Free-Protein-Bar-Alternative-4-Pk/602941020?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">pastries</a>.  A good general rule of thumb is if there are multiple lines of ingredients, or ingredients you can't pronounce, you probably shouldn't be eating it often.  Look for foods with just a handful of real, whole food, ingredients (we've come back full circle to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/RXBAR-Variety-Pack-Chewy-Protein-Bars-Ready-to-Eat-Protein-Snack-10-Count/331912964?from=/search">RxBars</a>).

<br><i><font size="+2">Rice Cakes</font></i><br>
&emsp;Rice cakes just scream 1990's low fat craze to me.  They're basically all carbs and starch, but they're super light and airy; 1 whole rice cake weighs just 9 g and contains only 35 calories and 7 g of carbs.  They can be a great way to get some more carbs into your diet without going overboard like most snacks.  I'll be honest and say have some <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quaker-Gluten-Free-Lightly-Salted-Rice-Cakes-4-47oz/10312599?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Lightly Salted Rice Cakes</a> in my cabinet right now.  

&emsp;They're super customizable; think anyway you'd enjoy toast, you can do as a rice cake.  Rice cakes area be a great base, and you can easily top with some healthy fats (nuts or avocado), protein (yogurt or cottage cheese), or fruit (berries, bananas, apples, etc.).  Some sweet examples are:<br>

&emsp;You can make them savory too; sometimes I mix some plain nonfat greek yogurt or <a href="/recipes/guacamole">Holy Guacamole</a> with some spices, and top with sliced tomatoes, cucumber, or any other fresh produce in my fridge at the time.  Or you can just simply spread on some hummus.  Here are my homemade hummus recipes:<br>

&emsp;As with most things, make sure to get the plain variety.  The lightly salted ones contain nothing but brown rice and salt, 2 healthy ingredients.  The problem comes with the flavored rice cakes, like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quaker-Gluten-Free-Caramel-Rice-Cakes-6-5-oz/10312601?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Caramel</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quaker-Rice-Cakes-Whole-Grain-Chocolate-Gluten-Free-7-23-oz/13448658?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">Chocolate</a>, or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Quaker-Gluten-Free-Rice-Cakes-Variety-Pack-6-Bags/574038295?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">White Cheddar</a>.  Calories can double, sugar is added, and the ingredients list expands.

<div id="white-rice"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">White Rice</font></i><br>
&emsp;<a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Long-Grain-Enriched-Rice-32-oz/10315394?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">White rice</a> is fairly processed, removing the hull and bran and leaving just the starch.  It's basically the white flour equivalent for rice.  With just the starch, white rice is lacking the fiber, vitamins, and minerals of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Natural-Brown-Long-Grain-Rice-32-oz/10898755?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">brown rice</a>, which is why it's often enriched with micronutrients (the same is done with white bread).  More starch and less fiber leads to greater insulin spikes, increasing your risk for diabeter and metabilic syndrome.  Now I'm not saying that white rice is the most unhealthy thing in the world, far from it; I'm just simply saying there are better options.  Instead of white rice, try instead using brown rice, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gourmet-House-Cultivated-Rice-Long-Grain-Wild-Rice-1-lb-Bag/534646756?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">wild rice</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Success-Boil-in-Bag-Quinoa-Tri-Color-Quinoa-12-oz-4-Count/400339803?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">quinoa</a>, <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/RiceSelect-Original-Couscous-Moroccan-Style-Couscous-26-5-oz-Jar/10403512?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">couscous</a>, or even riced <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Cauliflower-12-oz-Bag-Frozen/242699420?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">cauliflower</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Frozen-Broccoli-Florets-12-oz-Steamable-Bag/735585383?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">broccoli</a>.  I like have rice on the side with my meals, either plain, as my <a href="/recipes/rice-and-beans">Classic Rice and Beans</a>, or <a href="/recipes/cauliflower-rice">Simple Cauliflower Rice</a>.  Rice also works great mixed into dishes, such as <a href="/recipes/baked-rice-and-beans">Baked Rice and Beans with Vegetables</a> or <a href="/recipes/lebanese-casserole">Lebanese Riced Cauliflower Casserole</a>.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/white-rice.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
<div id="flour"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Flour</font></i><br>
&emsp;If you've noticed, all of my recipes stay away from <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-All-Purpose-Enriched-Flour-5LB-Bag/10403017?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">white flour</a>, also known as all purpose flour.  Instead, I opt for <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/King-Arthur-Flour-100-Premium-Whole-Wheat-Flour-80-oz/10535109?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">whole wheat flour</a> in recipes with gluten, and probably either <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Whole-Grain-Quick-Rolled-Oats/10314926?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">oat flour</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Organic-Coconut-Flour-36-oz/225301474?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">coconut flour</a> in gluten free dishes.  So why not all purpose flour?  Below is a diagram showing the anatomy of a grain of wheat.  Grinding togther the whole kernel (the bran, germ, and endosperm) will yield whole wheat flour, which is rich in nutrients like fiber, protein, calcium, iron, potassium, and some B vitamins (B1, B3, and B5).  It also contains a small amount of fat, which in combination with the high fiber content of whole wheat flour leads to much lower spikes in blood sugar.  Whole wheat flour can be used just like regular all purpose flour in baking, and leaves you with a great nutty flavor that adds a lot of depth to your baking.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/wheat.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;But if you grind down just the endosperm, you end up with white flour.  White flour is white due to both the white endosperm center and bleaching.  All the nutrients are in the other parts (the bran and the germ), leaving just the starchy center with nothing but empty calories and a massive spike in your blood sugar.  There's a reason why most commercial white flours and white <a rel="" target="" href="#bread">breads</a> are "fortified" or "enriched".  White flour is entirely stripped of its nutrients, so manufacturers have to "add" them back in.  Not only is white flour much more processed and refined than whole wheat, being devoid of any flavor, but its minerals aren't as bioavable as compared to the ones naturally occuring in whole wheat flour.  Whenever feasible, it is best to avoid using and consuming products with refined white flour, and instead opt for more whole grain options.

<div id="bread"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Bread</font></i><br>
&emsp;As discussed, <a rel="" target="" href="#flour">white flour</a> is generally a poor nutrition choice; it would then follow that <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wonder-Bread-Classic-White-Sandwich-Bread-Sliced-White-Bread-20-oz/37858875?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">white bread</a> would also not be your healthiest option.  Though <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Arnold-Whole-Grains-100-Bread-24-oz-Whole-Wheat-Soft-Wheat-Bread-Bag/10403544?athbdg=L1300&from=/search">whole wheat bread</a> isn't that much better of an option if we're still talking about commercially processed bread products.  Most store bought loaves of bread are high in our old friend, added sugar (a lot of whole wheat breads actually contain more sugar than their white bread counterparts), as well as vegetable oils and preservatives.  Look at that giant list of ingredients below!  There's a reason why grocery store bread can last for weeks without going bad, whereas real bread from a bakery goes stale in just a day or two (tip: store extra fresh baked bread in the freezer, it'll last forever in there).  Traditionally, bread is just flour, water, yeast, and salt; one of man's oldest and simplest creations.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/bread.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
&emsp;Bread is a soft spot for me; baking bread is what first got me into cooking during COVID (no I've never made sourdough; apparently I missed that memo).  The process of creating a loaf of whole wheat bread from scratch is my favorite thing to do in the kitchen, leading me to enjoy the delicious resulting loaf more than the cake like loaves bread you typically see on store shelves.  There's a reason my most Europeans describe American bread as being way too sweet, and why Ireland declared Subway "bread" to instead be cake due to its high sugar content.  White bread is essentially entirely made up of glucose, leading to the largest blood sugar spike of any food you could consume.  Even whole wheat bread is a high GI food, but it is significantly lower than white bread.  Below is a chart of different foods and their respective GI values.

<div id="muffins"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Muffins</font></i><br>
&emsp;Muffins are unfrosted cupcakes that somehow get a pass as a breakfast food.  These <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Marketside-Blueberry-Muffins-14-oz-4-Count/19758064?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Blueberry Muffins</a> have 350 calories per muffin with 21 g of added sugar and 17 g of fat.  They're filled with a ton of ingredients, and contain almost as much sugar as flour.  I used to make muffins decently often (<a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/banana-chocolate-chip-muffins/#wprm-recipe-container-174068">banana chocolate chip</a> specifically).  Just take a look: 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 3/4 cup of sugar, as well as 1.5 cups of white flour, for just a dozen muffins.  If that sounds like a lot, that's because it is.  Most "breakfast" options are just a meal of dessert.  Which is fine in moderation if you know what you're getting yourself into.  A muffin can be a fine dessert on occasion, but is a terrible start to your day.  Sorry, but a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Marketside-Triple-Chocolate-Muffins-14-oz-4-Count/987289191?from=/search">Triple Chocolate Muffin</a> is just a brownie.

<div id="banana-bread"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Banana Bread</font></i><br>
&emsp;So take <a rel="" target="" href="#muffins">muffins</a>, mash some bananas into it, and bake it in a loaf pan.  What you end up with is <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Marketside-Banana-Nut-Sliced-Cake-14-1-oz-8-Count/1407294647?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">banana bread</a>.  A delicious cake, no doubt, but not a breakfast, bread, or a healthy snack.  Just because it has bananas or nuts doesn't make it healthy; it's still a dessert.  At least this one below is honest and refers to itself as a cake.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/banana-bread.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;As for healthier homemade versions, you should check out my <a href="/recipes/banana-bread">Breakfast Banana Bread</a>, <a href="/recipes/banana-protein">Protein Banana Nut Bread</a>, or <a href="/recipes/double-chocolate-banana-bread">Double Chocolate Banana Bread</a>.

<div id="pancakes"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Pancakes and Waffles</font></i><br>
&emsp;Last on the chopping block for breakfast foods are pancakes and waffles.  Take your banana bread recipe, and cook it instead on a frying pan for pancakes or a waffle maker for waffles.  Just the same dessert in a different shape again, being filled with sugar and refined flour, leading to massive spikes and crashes in your blood sugar, energy, and mood.

<center><img src="/assets/Food/Breakfast/Pumpkin Pancake/pancake-cover.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;I'll be honest, I absolutely loved waffles growing up.  I'd make myself chocolate chip banana waffles once a week in high school by following a boxed mix, mashed in a banana, and fold in chocolate chips.  They're delicious, but again not something to start your day off with.  Instead, consider a pancake (or waffle) recipe made of protein and whole grains, like my <a href="/recipes/pancake">Pumpkin Protein Pancakes</a>.

<div id="chocolate"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Dark Chocolate</font></i><br>
&emsp;Dark chocolate is one of those foods that people think is healthy, but they're probably eating the wrong variety.  Just being labeled as "dark" chocolate doesn't automatically make it good for you; a lot of it is just well marketed candy.  Let's start with the benefits though.  True dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, mangesium, copper, and manganese.  Cocoa is also a great source of antioxidants, which decrease your body's free radicals and lower inflamation, due to its high concentration fo flavanols.  

&emsp;Dark chocolate is also a good source of healthy fats, though this can make it quite calorically dense.  True dark chocolate is a healthy snack, but, just like <a rel="" target="" href="#nuts">nuts</a>, should be measured and enjoyed in moderation due to its high calorie content.

&emsp;Here are a few examples of some chocolates that are wrongly considered healthy.  This <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/GHIRARDELLI-Sea-Salt-Caramel-Dark-Chocolate-Squares-Bar-4-8-oz-Bar/732356296?from=/search">Dark Chocolate Sea Salt Caramel</a> bar has sugar as the first ingredient.  This isn't a healthy snack; rather it's a candy.  Let's look at another; the "special" part about <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Hershey-s-Special-Dark-Mildly-Sweet-Chocolate-Giant-Candy-Bar-7-56-oz-25-Pieces/555582083?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">Hershey's Special Dark</a> is that it's not even dark chocolate, containing only 45% cocoa solids.  Finally, to put things into perspective, these <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Dark-Chocolate-Baking-Chips-10-oz-Bag/890876952?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">60% chocolate chips</a> contain just 1 g less of sugar than <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Milk-Chocolate-Chips-11-5-oz/858746232?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">milk chocolate chips</a>.  These numbers don't look that bad, but remember that 1 serving (1 tbsp, 15 g) of chocolate chips is a tiny amount, about a small handful.  No one is eating just that.

<center><img src="/assets/Misc/Trap/choc.jpg" alt="" class="larger-image"></center><br>
&emsp;Certainly be wary of anything claiming to be "dark" chocolate without even listing a cocoa percentage, as it's probably just barely higher than most milk chocolates.  I'd say at minimum, you should opt for anything over <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lindt-Excellence-70-Cocoa-Dark-Chocolate-Candy-Bar-3-5-oz-Bar/10312259?from=/search">70%</a> to be considered healthy.  Higher cocoa percentages mean lower sugar content, going all the way up to <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Baker-s-Unsweetened-Chocolate-Premium-Baking-Bar-with-100-Cacao-4-oz-Box/24183293?from=/search">100%</a> for the most bitter and strong flavor.  Personally, if I'm eating a piece of chocolate, I like <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lindt-Excellence-90-Cocoa-Dark-Chocolate-Candy-Bar-3-5-oz-Bar/21268921?athbdg=L1600&from=/search">90%</a> or higher; sometimes I enjoy a 100% bar of chocolate; unsweetened and delicious (just work your way up to it; it can be quite bitter if you're used to typical candy).

&emsp;A bar of chocolate is typically made of of 3 parts.  Firstly, the cocoa powder itself, which gives it bitter chocolate flavor.  Second, is some sort of saturated fat (typically cocoa butter), which mixes with the cocoa powder and allows it to stay solid at room temperture.  Stop here, and you have unsweetened chocolate; otherwise, add sugar (the third part) to make it sweeter.  

&emsp;Instead of paying $3.37 for <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Lindt-Excellence-100-Cocoa-Dark-Chocolate-Candy-Bar-1-7-oz-Bar/288993864?athbdg=L1200&from=/search">100% Chocolate</a>, I can make it myself for just $0.94.  I prefer to make my own <a href="/recipes/chocolate-bar">Sugar Free Chocolate Bar</a> by mixing together equal parts (by weight) of cocoa powder and coconut oil.   Sweetener is optional; sometimes I like a little honey or maple syrup to make it more like 85-90% chocolate, or sometimes I leave it at 100%.  If you want it sweeter without and sugar, you should try using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carob-Powder-Alternative-non-GMO-Superfood/dp/B0831TDPLJ/ref=sr_1_5_pp?sr=8-5">carob powder</a> (though it is more expensive), which tastes just like chocolate, but is midly sweet.  I used it for a bar of <a href="/recipes/chocolate-free-chocolate">Chocolate Free Chocolate</a> by combining just coconut oil and carob powder for a taste very similar to an 85% bar.
