<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;Today I'm some homemade syrup to use as a liquid sweetener.  I had accidentally bought some seeded grapes, so I'll separate them into pulp and juice.  Then, I'll boil down the juice into a syrup, until it's about the consistency of honey.

&emsp;This will also work with any storebought or fresh squeezed juice; just boil until all the water has cooked off, and the sweet syrup remains.  You can use this in your baking in place of honey or maple syrup to give a slightly fruity tasted to your baked goods.

<u><font size="+2">Separating the Juice</font></u><br>
&emsp;In a food processor, add all your grapes; I had about 780 g.  Blend on high for 1-2 minutes.  Then, using a fine mesh strainer, strain the liquid into a medium pot, leaving behind the pulp.  Scrape the sides of the strainer with a wooden spoon to get as much juice out as possible.  I ended up with about 502 g of grape juice, and 206 g of grape pulp (meaning I had about 72 g of loss in the strainer and food processor).

&emsp;This pulp is all grape skins and seeds, which are both perfectly safe to eat.  I would assume that this is where all the nutrition lies, with the fiber of the skin and health fats of the seeds.  I'll mixing this into my morning yougrt; the little bit of crunch mixed in with everything is a very nice texture, plus it adds some mild sweetness.  It's essentially a non-cooked unsweetened jam.

&emsp;In the medium pot over medium heat, bring the juice to a boil.  Let it boil with occasional stirring until it has cooked down to a syrup, about 20-30 minutes.  Transfer to a bowl to cool.  I ended up with about 65 g of fruit syrup.

<u><font size="+2">Using the Syrup</font></u><br>
&emsp;Finally, it's time to use our hard earned sweetener.  I'll be making my <a href="/recipes/chickpea-brownies">Protein Brownie Bars</a>, and use this 65 g (about 3 tbsp) as my sweetener in place of the honey or stevia.  I simply just added the sweetener into the batter, blended it in, and baked as normal.
