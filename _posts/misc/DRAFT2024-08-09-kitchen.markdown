<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;I wanted to make a simple post about some kitchen products that I find helpful and use all the time.  None of these products are sponsored (let's be honest, this has 3 viewers lol), but I hope this can be of use to someone

<br><i><font size="+2">Chef Knife</font></i><br>
&emsp;A good chef knife is the most useful thing you could have in your kitchen.  A better knife is one of those things you don't think you need until you try it out, and you realize what you've been missing.  Cooking at other people's houses with dull knives and crappy cutting board makes cooking (something I love to do) into a boring chore.  A sharp knife is crucial, allowing for quicker and safer chopping.

&emsp;It doesn't need to be anything fancy or expensive.  I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WW6VGHX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this one</a> on Amazon for less than $15.  Just make sure to take good care of it; sharpen it often, and only hand wash it.

<div id="knife-sharpener"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Knife Sharpener</font></i><br>
&emsp;A simple pull through sharpener is a great gadget to have in the kitchen.  I got mine as a gift, but something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Knife-Sharpener-Sharpening-Cut-Resistant/dp/B079WWFZY6/ref=sr_1_5?sr=8-5">this</a> should do the trick.  Aim to sharpen your knife every few days.  If you find you're squishing tomatoes or crying from onions, your knife is due for a sharpening.

<div id="cutting-board"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Cutting Boards</font></i><br>
&emsp;The logical next step from knives is cutting boards.  Having a nice large, heavy cutting board to fit all your vegetables is such an improvement over a tiny, flimsy board where you're cramped for space and that slides around.  There are 3 typical types of cutting boards, and unfortunately I have issues with all of them.

&emsp;First up is glass.  I'm not gonna beat around the bush; I hate glass cutting boards.  Everything slides around, making cutting anything way more difficult and dangerous.  Plus, glass dulls knives a ton.  It'll turn your chef knife into a butter knife in no time.

&emsp;Second is plastic.  Plastic cutting board are personally what I use (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VV9X31M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this set</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBOTQ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this one</a> specifically), but I'm looking to upgrade.  Plastic is easy, cheap, and convienient; however I'm personally weary of the harm of using plastic to cut my food.  These types of cutting board wear away after a while, and I would prefer not to be consuming microplastics.  To be fully transparent, I know next to nothing on this issue, but my intuition would tell me that plastic cutting boards are probably not good for your long term health.

&emsp;Finally, we have wooden.  It doesn't dull knives like glass; it doesn't cause microplastics in my food or get food stuck in it constantly like plastic.  Then what's my problem with wood?  I'm lazy (lmao), and I don't want to hand wash it (I'm also prone to extremely dry hands, so hand washing dishes is a no-go for me).  When I eventually find a nice large wooden or bamboo cutting board that can be safely used in the dishwasher I'll be ready to upgrade.  They can also be quite pricy.  I'm all ears; let me hear your recommendations.

<div id="food-processor"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Food Processor</font></i><br>
&emsp;I use my food processor all the time; debatably too much.  All the time I'm either making spreads and sauces like <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">Natural Nut Butter</a> or <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a>.  I also use it frequently for healthy baking and protein baking, such as with <a href="/recipes/date-brownie">Almond Date Brownie</a> or <a href="/recipes/banana-protein">Protein Banana Nut Bread</a>.  The food processor I currently own is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00755KNCS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8">this one</a>.  It's 8 cups, powerful, has a cheese shredding attachement, as is dishwasher safe (top rack only).  When this one eventually dies though, I want something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Processor-Vegetable-Shredding/dp/B08MB664XB">this</a>, which also has an attachment for making <a href="/recipes/spaghetti-taco">zoodles</a>.
