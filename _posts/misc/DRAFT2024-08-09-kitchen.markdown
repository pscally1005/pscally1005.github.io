<u><font size="+2">Introduction</font></u><br>
&emsp;I wanted to make a simple post about some kitchen products that I find helpful and use all the time.  None of these products are sponsored (let's be honest, this has 3 viewers lol), but I hope this can be of use to someone

<div id="chef-knife"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Chef Knife</font></i><br>
&emsp;Outside of a <a rel="" target="" href="#food-scale">kitchen scale</a>, a good chef knife is the most useful thing you could have in your kitchen.  A better knife is one of those things you don't think you need until you try it out, and you realize what you've been missing.  Cooking at other people's houses with dull knives and crappy <a rel="" target="" href="#cutting-board">cutting boards</a> makes cooking (something I love to do) into a boring chore.  A sharp knife is crucial, allowing for quicker and safer chopping.

&emsp;It doesn't need to be anything fancy or expensive.  I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WW6VGHX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this one</a> on Amazon for less than $15.  Just make sure to take good care of it; sharpen it often, and only hand wash it.

<div id="knife-sharpener"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Knife Sharpener</font></i><br>
&emsp;A simple pull through sharpener is a great gadget to have in the kitchen.  I got mine as a gift, but something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Knife-Sharpener-Sharpening-Cut-Resistant/dp/B079WWFZY6/ref=sr_1_5?sr=8-5">this</a> should do the trick.  Aim to sharpen your <a rel="" target="" href="#chef-knife">knife</a> every few days.  If you find you're squishing tomatoes or crying from onions, your knife is due for a sharpening.

<div id="cutting-board"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Cutting Boards</font></i><br>
&emsp;The logical next step from <a rel="" target="" href="#chef-knife">knives</a> is cutting boards.  Having a nice large, heavy cutting board to fit all your vegetables is such an improvement over a tiny, flimsy board where you're cramped for space and that slides around.  There are 3 typical types of cutting boards, and unfortunately I have issues with all of them.

&emsp;First up is glass.  I'm not gonna beat around the bush; I hate glass cutting boards.  Everything slides around, making cutting anything way more difficult and dangerous.  Plus, glass dulls knives a ton.  It'll turn your chef knife into a butter knife in no time.

&emsp;Second is plastic.  Plastic cutting board are personally what I use (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VV9X31M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this set</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBOTQ8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this one</a> specifically), but I'm looking to upgrade.  Plastic is easy, cheap, and convienient; however I'm personally weary of the harm of using plastic to cut my food.  These types of cutting board wear away after a while, and I would prefer not to be consuming microplastics.  To be fully transparent, I know next to nothing on this issue, but my intuition would tell me that plastic cutting boards are probably not good for your long term health.

&emsp;Finally, we have wooden.  It doesn't dull knives like glass; it doesn't cause microplastics in my food or get food stuck in it constantly like plastic.  Then what's my problem with wood?  I'm lazy (lmao), and I don't want to hand wash it (I'm also prone to extremely dry hands, so hand washing dishes is a no-go for me).  When I eventually find a nice large wooden or bamboo cutting board that can be safely used in the dishwasher I'll be ready to upgrade.  They can also be quite pricy.  I'm all ears; let me hear your recommendations.

<div id="food-processor"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Food Processor</font></i><br>
&emsp;I use my food processor all the time; debatably too much.  All the time I'm either making <a href="/recipes/sweet-spreads">spreads</a> and <a href="/recipes/savory-sauces">sauces</a> like <a href="/recipes/natural-peanut-butter">Natural Nut Butter</a> or <a href="/recipes/roasted-beet-hummus">Creamy Roasted Beet Hummus</a>.  I also use it frequently for healthy baking and protein baking, such as with <a href="/recipes/date-brownie">Almond Date Brownie</a> or <a href="/recipes/banana-protein">Protein Banana Nut Bread</a>.  The food processor I currently own is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00755KNCS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8">this one</a>.  It's 8 cups, powerful, has a cheese shredding attachement, as is dishwasher safe (top rack only).  When this one eventually dies though, I want something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hamilton-Beach-Processor-Vegetable-Shredding/dp/B08MB664XB">this</a>, which also has an attachment for making <a href="/recipes/spaghetti-taco">zoodles</a>.

<div id="vegetable-chopper"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Vegetable Chopper</font></i><br>
&emsp;A simple vegetable chopped can range from manual to electric.  It makes finely dicing onion or nuts so much easier, and I use mine fairly often.  My parents have a manual one (something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OXO-11339900-Good-Grips-Chopper/dp/B09WFWN76D/ref=sr_1_15_f3_0o_wf_mod_primary_alm?sbo=m6DjfpMzMLDmL8pSMKX8hw%3D%3D&sr=8-15">this</a>), and I have an electric one (like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Immersion-Handheld-Variable-Emulsion-Smoothies/dp/B0CPLVLFK2/ref=sxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?cv_ct_cx=vegetable%2Bchopper%2Band%2Bimmersion%2Bblender&sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&sr=1-2-320c8157-e12c-4633-a9a3-0e0d4c4cb4b0-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM">this one</a>).  Bonus points for my chopper also having an immersion blender, a very useful tool from time to time.  My immersion blender gets used most for <a href="/recipes/apple-spread">No Sugar Added Apple Spread</a>, instead of transferring the apples to a full on blender.

<div id="blender"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Blender</font></i><br>
&emsp;Between my food processor for heavy duty large jobs and my electric veggie chopper for quick and small things, I don't use my blender too often.  But most people probably use a blender more than me.  I went on a big smoothie kick in high school and college, and my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-Professional-Countertop-Technology-BL610/dp/B00NGV4506/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1">Ninja Blender</a> definitely came in handy there.  Vic likes to make smoothies every week or 2, and a blender is perfect for that.

<div id="air-fryer"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Air Fryer</font></i><br>
&emsp;Air fryers are immensely useful, and mine gets used nearly every day.  It's great for making <a href="/recipes/baked-sweet-potato">Baked Sweet Potatoes</a> and <a href="/recipes/breaded-chicken">Breaded Chicken Cutlets</a>, reheating frozen leftovers (such as <a href="/recipes/chicken-nuggets">Freezer Chicken Nuggets</a> and <a href="/recipes/broccoli-fries">Air Fryer Broccoli Fries</a>), as well as single-handedly replacing my toaster oven.  I even make my <a href="/recipes/hard-boiled-egg">Hard Boiled Eggs</a> in the air fryer instead of on the stovetop.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VHFMZHJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">This</a> is the one that I have, and it works like a charm.  You can also dehydrate in it too, as I did in my <a href="/recipes/chicken-jerky">Air Fryer Chicken Jerky</a>.

<center><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VHFMZHJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1"><img src="/assets/Misc/Kitchen/air-fryer.jpg" alt="" class="instruction-image"></a></center><br>
<div id="silicone-liners"></div>
<br><i><font size="+2">Silicone Liners</font></i><br>
&emsp;Silicone liners are great to have around.  They make cleanup so much easier, and they cut back on waste, as opposed to using disposable parchment paper every time.  I have ones for both my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Silicone-Non-Stick-Rectangular/dp/B077XTPWZ5/ref=sr_1_27?sr=8-27">oven sheet pans</a> and my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C58RP6G9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8">air fryer</a>.  It's especially useful when using the <a rel="" target="" href="#air-fryer">air fryer</a>, as it's handwash only.  Pop one of those instead, and the air fryer stays totally clean.  Same thing with <a rel="" target="" href="#pans">pans</a>.  As long as the pan doesn't get dirty, just a light rinse will do; no need to fully wash it.
