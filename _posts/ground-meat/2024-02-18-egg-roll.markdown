Description: Shredded cabbage makes such a good base for a meal, just like rice or noodles would. These bowls are like a deconstructed version of an egg roll, and they're packed with vegetables and feature a flavorful sauce.
Instructions: 
- You can either buy a bags of shredded cabbage and carrots, or shred them yourself.  I like to cut them into big chunks, pulse them in my food processor, and use that.  It's cheaper and simpler, but you don't get the strips that a mandolin would get you.  Sorry for calling for 17 cups lol, just use a large head of cabbage<br><br>

- Heat a large wok over medium to medium high heat. Add the cabbage, carrots, a pinch of salt, and a drizzle of olive oil<br><br>

- Cover the wok with aluminum foil and cook the vegetables until softened to desired texture<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a large pan or wok, brown the meat with the spices (onion and garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, ginger, pepper, and salt) over medium heat. Mix in soy sauce and gochujang at the end<br><br>

- Mix together the sauce in a bowl or glass. Optionally add some peanut butter<br><br>

- Pour the sauce onto the cooked vegetables. Mix in the meat, season to taste with lemon, soy sauce, and salt, and serve
