Description: This is my healthy take on a classic burger sandwich. I've kept it simple with just a patty and my <a href="burger-buns">No Yeast Whole Wheat Burger Buns</a>, so feel free to add whatever toppings or sauces you desire, like lettuce, tomato, and my homemade burger sauce, that you can find in my <a href="burger-bowl">Chopped Burger Bowl with Sweet Potatoes</a>
Instructions: 
- Combine all burger ingredients together in a bowl - meat, soy sauce, oil, paprika, garlic, onion, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper<br><br>

- Shape the meat into 4 equally sized balls, about 120 g each. Flatten into a burger patty shape (I should have flattened these more; keep in mind they will shrink a lot), and seal the sides to make an even circle with no jutting out edges. Lightly wetting your hands may help to prevent sticking<br><br>

- Add your 4 patties to a preheated 400F air fryer. Air fry for 8-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the patties are at least 165F. Let sit for 5 minutes before assembling into burgers<br><br>

- You could also cook them on a grill outside, or use a grill pan (or regular frying pan) over medium heat on your stove. Cook for a few minutes each side, flipping occasionally, until done to your liking
