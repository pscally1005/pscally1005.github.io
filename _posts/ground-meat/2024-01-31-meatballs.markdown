Description: These meatballs are gluten free, and can be made with ground beef, turkey, or chicken. They taste great, and can be eaten on their own, or mixed into a sauce and pasta, like I did here with zucchini noodles. I used my homemade unsweetened pasta sauce recipe here, but feel free to use whatever sauce you desire. Pesto would be great too
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 400F, and prepare a large cookie sheet with parchment paper<br><br>

- In a large bowl, beat your egg, and mix with the rest of the ingredients. Mix with your hands until just combined<br><br>

- Scoop your mixture (using a cookie scoop helps), roll into balls, and place on your sheet pans<br><br>

- Roast the meatballs in your 400F oven for about 14-16 minutes, or until cooked through and reach a temperature of at least 165F. Set aside<br><br>

- Meanwhile, warm up (or cook) your sauce in a medium pot over medium low heat<br.<br>

- As the sauce simmers, use a spiralizer to cut the zucchini into zoodles, and add to a large pan with oil over medium heat. Season, cover, and cook until desired texture is reached<br><br>

- Mix together the sauce and the zoodles. Top with meatballs and serve
