Description: Taco Tuesday was a tradition among friends in college, and this recipe suits a crowd really well. Just like my <a href="fajitas">Chicken Fajitas with Peppers</a> recipe, these are an awesome way for each person to build their own meals and have fun at the table. For a no garlic and onion version, see my <a href="low-fodmap-tacos">Low FODMAP Chicken Tacos</a> recipe.  Invite some people over to make tacos and whip up some <a href="salsa">Five Minute Salsa (No Garlic/Onion)</a> or <a href="guacamole">Holy Guacamole</a>; what are you waiting for!
Instructions: 
- Mix together seasonings in a medium bowl or mason jar and set aside<br><br>

- Start with the peppers and onions, since they will take the longest. Preheat a 12" nonstick pan over medium heat with a spray of oil. Wash the vegetables, and cut into long thin strips. Add to the pan with some oil and garlic<br><br>

- Season with your spice mix, about 2 tbsp. Cover and cook until soft, browned, and lightly charred, about 20 minutes. Finish with lime juice<br><br>

- As the peppers cook, move over to the meat. Heat a large pan on medium heat. Add the oil, garlic, and meat to the pan. Brown the meat, and cook until no longer pink<br><br>

- Stir in the rest spice mixture and pour in water. Reduce heat to 2 and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncovered<br><br>

- Stir in the apple cider vinegar and lime juice. Simmer until flavors combine, 3-4 minutes<br><br>
