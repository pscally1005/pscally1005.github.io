Description: This meatloaf is a little unorthodox, adding a whole pound of chopped spinach. It's a great alternative to my classic meatloaf, containing more vegetables but still the same great flavor. It also doesn't use BBQ sauce, so this is good for when you've run out. I've paired it with some roasted butternut squash to act as a vegetable and carb side.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F. Line 2 bread pans with parchment for the meatloaf, and line a large cookie sheet with parchment for the squash<br><br>

- Starting with the squash, peel it and slice in half. Scoop out the seeds, and cut into a large dice. Move the squash to a bowl, and season (oil, minced garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, and salt).  One large butternut squash is the enough<br><br>

- Roast at 350F for about 45 minutes<br><br>

- As the squash cooks, move on to the meatloaf. Mix all meatloaf ingredients together in a bowl - meat, egg, spinach (pat it dry first with paper towels), oat flour, cheese, dijon mustard, soy sauce, apple cider vingar, chili powder, paprika, garlic and onion powder, cumin, black pepper, salt, and ginger<br><br>

- Spray the parchment paper in the bread pans, and put meat on the pan. Shape into a loaf, and insert a meat thermometer into the front.<br><br>

- Bake at 350F until meat is done (a least 160F for beef and 165F for turkey), or about 45 minutes, depending on the thickness of your loaf.  Serve with <a href="bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a> on the side
