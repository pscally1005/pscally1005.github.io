Description: These Greek inspired bowls feature ground chicken, feta cheese, and plenty of vegetables. It goes great mixed into a side of brown rice or orzo pasta. It's a great summertime healthy meal that I know you'll enjoy.
Instructions: 
- Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add in your diced onion, with oil, garlic, and salt. Cover, and cook until the onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- Add the cucumbers, spinach, and spices (basil, onion and garlic powder, and lemon pepper) to the pan and cook for just a few minutes on medium. Squeeze in the lemon juice, and then set the vegetables aside in a bowl<br><br>

- To the now empty pan, add the chicken, oil, and garlic. Cook over medium heat until fully cooked and no longer pink. Season (basil, onion and garlic powder, lemon pepper, and black pepper), finish with lemon juice, and add the chicken to the bowl with the vegetables<br><br>

- Mix the feta into the food and serve with rice (1 cup dry brown rice)
