Description: This recipe is a modified version of my mom's casserole recipe. Fun fact - I hated this recipe as a kid, but I love it now. Maybe it was the nuts or the spinach, both of which I love now. Feel free to use whatever nuts you have on hand; here I used chopped pine nuts, but almonds or pistachios would work great. Feel free to use brown rice (1 cup dry, 185 g) instead of cauliflower rice
Instructions: 
- Defrost your bag of spinach, and cut your onions into a small dice. Add to a large pan with oil, cumin, pepper, and salt. Cover and cook over medium heat until the onions are soft and translucent. Set aside in a bowl<br><br>

- Over medium, heat, add the meat and some oil. Cook the meat until properly browned. Season with soy sauce, allspice, cinnamon, and salt. Toast the nuts and garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer to the bowl with the spinach<br><br>

- As everything else is cooking, you can prepare your cauliflower rice. Add your defrosted florets to a food processor, and pulse until you have a fully chopped rice-like cauliflower. Don't overblend<br><br>

- When the meat is done and the pan is free, add the cauliflower to the pan with oil, lemon pepper, garlic and onion powders, nutmeg, cloves, and red pepper flakes. Cover and cook over medium heat until the cauliflower is tender and done to your liking. Don't over mix, or it could become mushy<br><br>
