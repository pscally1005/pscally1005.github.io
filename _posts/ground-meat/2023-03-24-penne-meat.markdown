Description: This ground meat and penne baked casserole was my go to for feeding a crowd during my running club pasta parties in college. They're really easy to make a day ahead, and simply just reheat in the pan on the day of your event. Feel free to mix in some chopped spinach as well, or serve with a side of roasted broccoli, such as my <a href="running-club-broccoli">Running Club Broccoli</a>
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 375F. Spray 9x13in pan with cooking spray<br><br>

- Cook you pasta according to the packaging, drain, and set aside. Cook about a minute less than directed, since the pasta will bake in the oven<br><br>

- Heat olive oil over medium high heat in a Dutch oven. Add garlic, onion, and salt, and cook until the onion is transparent<br><br>

- Add the meat and fully cook (meat should sound like its crackling instead of boiling).<br><br>

- After the meat is done, add in the spices (garlic and onion powder, oregano, basil, thyme, and pepper) and pour in tomatoes. Let simmer for 5 minutes.<br><br>

- Combine beef, pasta, and cheese in the pot.<br><br>

- Transfer to greased pan. Sprinkle breadcrumbs on top<br><br>

- Bake covered at 375F for 30 minutes. Uncover, and broil until the top is golden, probably about 2 minutes. Watch very closely. When baking, put the pan on a large cookie sheet to catch any drips if they occur
