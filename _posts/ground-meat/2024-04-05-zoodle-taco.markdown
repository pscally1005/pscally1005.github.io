Description: Anyone else remember spaghetti tacos from iCarly and desperately want to try them? I wanted to make it a complete meal, so I've swapped the spaghetti for zoodles (to avoid the double carb of taco shell and pasta), as well as added meat and more vegetables. These go great with whole wheat or keto tortillas, or even on its own
Instructions: 
- In a small bowl, mix together the spices for the taco seasoning - chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, and oregano. Set aside<br><br>

- Use a spiralizer to cut your zucchini into zoodles. Add to a large pan with olive oil over medium heat. Season with 1-2 tbsp of your taco seasoning<br><br>

- Cover, and cook for a few minutes under occasional stirring, until the noodles have lightly softened and water is released. Set aside in a bowl<br><br>

- As the zucchini cooks, cut your peppers and onion into a small dice. When the pan is free, add veggies to the pan with oil over medium heat. Season with 1-2 tbsp of your taco seasoning<br><br>

- Cover and cook over medium heat, or until the peppers have softened and the onions are translucent and begin to caramelize. Set aside in the bowl with the noodles<br><br>

- Last but not least, the meat. When the pan is free, add in the ground meat and oil over medium heat. Cook until fully browned, and break up the meat with a wooden spoon<br><br>

- Season with the rest of your taco seasoning when the meat is fully cooked. Add minced garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds<br><br>

- Turn heat down to medium low, and pour in your diced tomatoes. Cover, and let simmer for about 10 minutes. The sauce should thicken and will be bubbling. Squeeze in some lime<br><br>

- Add the meat to the bowl with the vegetables. Combine together, and serve. Pair this with any hard or soft shelled tacos, cheese, and salsa
