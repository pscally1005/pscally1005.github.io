Description: These tacos are free of onion and garlic, and are made using ground chicken thighs (or any kind of ground meat you prefer; beef or turkey would work great here too!). These can also be served with <a href="rice-and-beans">Classic Rice and Beans</a>, <a href="tortilla">Oat-Wheat Tortillas</a>, cheese, and <a href="salsa">Five Minute Salsa (No Garlic/Onion)</a>. Also check out my standard <a href="taco">Sauteed Taco Meat and Fajita Veggies</a> recipe
Instructions: 
- Prepare your spice mix in a mason jar - paprika, cumin, oregano, black pepper, salt, cornstarch, and cayenne<br><br>

- Start with the peppers, since they will take the longest. Preheat a 12" nonstick pan over medium heat with a spray of oil. Wash the peppers, and cut into long thin strips. Add to the pan with some oil<br><br>

- Season the peppers with your spice mix, about 5 tsp. Cover and cook until soft, browned, and lightly charred, about 20 minutes. Finish with lemon (or lime) juice<br><br>

- As the peppers cook, move over to the meat. Heat a large pan on medium heat. Add the oil and meat to the pan. Brown the meat, and cook until no longer pink<br><br>

- Stir in the rest spice mixture and pour in water. Reduce heat to 2 and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes. Uncovered<br><br>

- Stir in the apple cider vinegar and lime (or lemon) juice. Simmer until flavors combine, 3-4 minutes<br><br>

- Serve with tortillas, rice, beans, cheese, and salsa
