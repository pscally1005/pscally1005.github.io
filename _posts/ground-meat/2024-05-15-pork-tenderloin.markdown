Description: I've never been a big fan of pork, but I've been wanting to give it a try, and I found some on sale a few days ago. Pork tenderloin is a very lean but still juicy cut of meat, as long as you cook it properly. It's also fairly cheap too, this was only $2.69 for 1 lb. I've paired this with a side of <a href="baked-sweet-potato">Baked Sweet Potatoes</a> and <a href="roasted-vegetables">Simply Roasted Vegetables</a>, but feel free to throw it together with whatever you have in your fridge
Instructions: 
- Trim any excess fat off the side of the meat, and cut into 4 pieces. Light season all sides with salt, pepper, and garlic<br><br>

- Preheat a pan over medium high heat with a spray of oil. Cook for 1.5-2 minutes before flipping the meat. The goal here is to brown all 4 sides, not to cook the meat through. Use tongs to flip the meat and brown all the sides, and then remove from the heat<br><br>

- Line a cookie sheet with parchment, and add your meat. Bake in a preheated 350F oven for 13-15 minutes, or until the pork is 150F. Let the meat rest for a few minutes before slicing<br><br>

- To keep things simple, I'll just be pairing the pork with some <a href="baked-sweet-potato">Baked Sweet Potatoes</a> and <a href="roasted-vegetables">Simply Roasted Vegetables</a>. You can check out those simple recipes, but I'll give you the short version here<br><br>

- For the potatoes - wash with a brush, poke with a fork, wrap in aluminum foil, and air fry at 400F for about 45 minutes<br><br>

- For the broccoli - take your defrosted bag of broccoli, and add to a parchment lined cookie sheet. Add some oil, season to taste with lemon pepper and garlic powder, and roast in the oven for about 45 minutes at 350F
