Description: Sloppy joes are an American classic, and this variation removes the sugar filled ketchup and adds some more vegetables as well. These go great on a plate with a side of rice, or even better on a sandwich.
Instructions: 
- Finely chop the peppers and onions.  Place a medium skillet over medium heat with oil. When the pan is hot, add onions and peppers. Saut√©, stirring occasionally<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a large skillet with oil, brown the meat. When the meat is nearly done, add the garlic and cook until fragrant<br><br>

- To the meat mixture, add the vegetables, tomato paste, water, mustard, vinegar, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine. Cook covered over medium-low heat (about 10 minutes) until hot and ground meat is cooked through and peppers are tender<br><br>

- Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.
