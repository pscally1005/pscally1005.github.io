Description: Beef and broccoli is a Chinese classic, and making this version at home is what got me to like steak if cooked properly. I saw a small piece of sirloin on sale at the store and wanted to try it out, and I'm very impressed with the results. Sauteed beef, broccoli, and a topping of sesame seeds sounds delicious in my book
Instructions: 
- Heat your oven to 400F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Add broccoli to the pan, season with salt, pepper, and oil, and roast for 30 minutes. Do everything else as the broccoli cooks<br><br>

- Take your meat and slice into 1/4-1/2" thick strips against the grain. Add to a bowl of cold water, and massage the meat for 30 seconds. The meat should turn gray, and the water should turn red with myagloben (not blood). Squeeze and drain the meat with a strainer for about 30 seconds, and add to a medium bowl<br><br>

- Add in the marinade (salt, starch, baking soda, soy sauce, and sesame oil). Mix to fully coat the meat, and let marinate for 15 minutes<br><br>

- Meanwhile, mix the sauce together in a glass - minced garlic, soy sauce, white vinegar ginger, garlic powder, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. In a separate glass, prepare some cold water and cornstarch for a slurry<br><br>

- Preheat a large stainless steel pan over medium high heat. Add in the beef, and cook for about 2 minutes per side, just until browned and not overcooked. Remove from the pan<br><br>

- Add in the sauce, broccoli, and about half of the slurry. Deglaze the pan, cook for about 2 minutes, and add more slurry if you want to thicken the sauce more. Add back in the beef<br><br>
