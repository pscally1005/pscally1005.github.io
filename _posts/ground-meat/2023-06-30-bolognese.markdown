Description: My Bolognese recipe is a sauce that can honestly work as a meal on it own. It goes great over some pasta, or even zucchini noodles like above. It also serves as a great stew between the meat and all the vegetables.
Instructions: 
- Add vegetables (onion, garlic, carrots, and peppers) to a food processor and pulse until fine<br><br>

- Spray a dutch oven with oil, and cook the vegetables until soft over medium high heat until water has boiled off. Stir constantly. Remove to a bowl<br><br>

- Over medium high, add the meat into the pan and mash with a wooden spoon, mixing with the vegetables until meat is cooked and no pink remains. Stir constantly, and cook until water is evaporated and pan goes from hissing to cracking (this is the sound of the meat frying in it's own rendered fat)<br><br>

- Add the tomato puree and mix until fully combined. Pour in water. Scrape up the fond with your wooden spoon. Mix back in the vegetables. Add the spices (bouillon powder, oregano, basil, parsley, themy, garlic powder, and black pepper) and balsamic vinegar<br><br>

- Bring to a boil on high, then cover and let simmer simmer (reduce heat to medium-low).  Let cook for 30 minutes - 1 hour, stirring every 15 minutes<br><br>
