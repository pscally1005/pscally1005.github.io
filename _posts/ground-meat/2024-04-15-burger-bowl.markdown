Description: These bowls are deconstructed burgers, instead making them into a healthy salad, with the buns swapped for roasted sweet potatoes. There's way more food for way less calories, with a lot of volume to this dish. It's full of all your favorite burger flavors, toppings, and my <a href="tomato-spread">Tomato Burger Spread</a>. If a classic burger is what you desire, see my <a href="burger-patties">Simple Burger Patties</a> and <a href="burger-buns">No Yeast Whole Wheat Burger Buns</a>
Instructions: 
- Starting with the potatoes. Wash and cut your sweet potatoes into cubes. You don't need to peel the potatoes. Add to a microwave save bowl, and toss with oil, soy sauce, and baking soda. Cover, and microwave on full power for 3 minutes to soften the potatoes<br><br>

- Remove the potatoes from the microwave, and toss with the seasonings - chili powder, paprika, garlic, onion, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper<br><br>

- Add to your air fryer in a single layer, and air fry at 400F for about 6-8 minutes, or until crispy but not burnt. Set aside<br><br>

- Moving onto the cheese. In a small bowl, mix together shredded cheese, cornstarch, and almond milk. This will get added into the beef at the end. Set the bowl aside<br><br>

- Now for the burger. Heat a large pan over medium heat with olive oil. Add in the beef, and cook until browned. Season with soy sauce, paprika, garlic, onion, black pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper<br><br>

- Add the bowl of cheese into the pan, mix, and cover. Cook for just a minute or so to melt the cheese and a creamy sauce forms. Set the pan aside<br><br>

- Meanwhile, chop up the vegetables for the salad. Wash your lettuce and tomatoes. Thinly slice the lettuce, cut the tomatoes into a medium dice, and the onions and pickles into a small dice. Set vegetables aside<br><br>

- Finally, it's time to assemble your bowls. Place the lettuce on the bottom as a base, and evenly top with your meat mixture. Add the vegetables on top around the sides, and spoon on your <a href="tomato-spread">Tomato Burger Spread</a>
