Description: A traditional pound cake is made with a pound each of eggs, sugar, butter, and flour; that's it. I wanted to create a healthier version with equal parts of 4 ingredients, so I came up with this. I made this as a joke, but it works wells as a 4 ingredient healthy cake.
Instructions: 
- Preheat your oven to 350F, and line 2 9x5" bread pans with parchment paper (only 1 if doing a 1/4 batch). Lightly spray the paper with oil<br><br>

- In a food processor, blend together all 4 ingredients (drained and rinsed chickpeas, peanuts, yogurt, and bananas) until everything is smooth<br><br>

- Optionally, add in some additional flavors. I went with a little salt and vanilla extract, but you can also add cinnamon or any other extract you have. Add a little maple syrup if you like it sweeter<br><br>

- Evenly split the batter across the 2 pans. For a 1/4 batch, you'll only need 1 pan<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 45 minutes (uncovered), or until a toothpick comes out almost clean, and the internal temperature is around 200F. For a 1/4 batch, it should take about 30 minutes, uncovered<br><br>

- Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Slice the loaves, and store in the fridge or freezer
