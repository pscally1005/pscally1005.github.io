Description: This was something stupid I did for April Fool's Day, where I passed them off as chocolate covered raisins. This is a fun and harmless prank to anyone not expecting it.
Instructions: 
- Preheat oven to 400F and line small baking sheet with aluminum foil<br><br>

- Cut garlic in half and take out the cloves. Leave the skin on<br><br>

- Line small baking sheet or plate with parchment paper. Add garlic into chocolate and mix, being carful to not break up cloves. Transfer cloves to parchment paper<br><br>

- Refrigerate to cool and solidify the chocolate. Store in a Ziploc in the fridge.<br><br>

- Serve on April Fool's Day or to your worst enemy.  If you're really evil, coat the garlic cloves raw, not roasted
