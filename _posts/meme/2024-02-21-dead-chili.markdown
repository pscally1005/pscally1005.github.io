Description: I was bored once and wanted to make possibly the simplest recipe ever. This chili is so easy that even a doorhanger could do it. No measuring, no cutting, just dump stuff in and go. It used an entire small container of chili powder, couldn't get any simpler than that lmao.
Instructions: 
- Open all your containers<br><br>
- <center><img src="/assets/Food/Meme/Chili/dead-chili-1.jpg" alt="" class="instruction-image"></center><br>

- Dump in and mix (don't drain anything)<br><br>

- Cook covered on low for 8 hours. Divide into containers
