Description: I came up with this idea, as it rhymes with PB&J, and serves as a tastier and healthier option for the classic sandwich. The added proteins in the peanut butter and jelly serve to make the sandwich more filling, and without the added sugars of typical jelly or jam. To make it even better, serve this on my whole wheat bread, which is linked below<br><p><a href="ww-bread">100% Whole Wheat Bread</a></p>
Instructions: 
- For the peanut butter - in a small bowl or glass, combine peanut butter, PB2, and milk<br><br>

- For the jelly - In a small bowl, mash the banana. Mix with the protein powder and cinnamon.  Add some sweetner if you like (1/4 tsp, 1.25 g liquid monk fruit or stevia)<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out almost clean, and internal temperature is around 205F.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely<br><br>

- Spread banana spread on one slice of bread. Spread the peanut butter on the other.
