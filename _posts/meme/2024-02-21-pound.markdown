Description: A traditional pound cake is made with a pound each of eggs, sugar, butter, and flour; that's it. I wanted to create a healthier version with equal parts of 4 ingredients, so I came up with this. I made this as a joke, but it works wells as a better 4 ingredient healthy cake. As to not end up with something massive, I used only a quarter pound of everything, so at least it's a pound total of raw ingredients.
Instructions: 
- In a food processor, blend together all the ingredients everything is finely chopped and mixed, about 2 minutes<br><br>

- Transfer to a parchment lined and sprayed 9x5" loaf pan<br><br>

- Bake in a preheated 350F oven for about 30 minutes or until a toothpick comes out almost clean, and internal temperature is around 205F.  Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely<br><br>
