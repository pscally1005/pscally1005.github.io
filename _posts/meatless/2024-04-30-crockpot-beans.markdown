Description: I normally only use canned beans, but I decided to use bagged beans today and they turned out really well. This recipe is adapted from the cookbook Run Fast Eat Slow. Just soak your beans overnight, and let them slow cook during the day. They're mildly seasoned, so they serve as a very versatile item in your fridge. I like to put some beans on my salad throughout the week, or eat them as a side with dinner. Any other dried beans will work here too
Instructions: 
- To soak the beans overnight - wash your bag of beans in a strainer under water. Add to a large bowl with 5 cups (1,200 g) water and 1 tbsp (18 g) salt. Stir, cover, and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 hours)<br><br>

- In the morning, discard the water, and add the beans to the pot of a slow cooker<br><br>

- Cut your onion and carrots into a small dice, and add to the slow cooker pot. Season with oil, garlic, chili powder, cumin, and salt<br><br>

- Pour in your water to just fully submerge the beans. Cover, and cook for 8 hours on low. You can add an additional hour on high (uncovered) if you want to cook off more liquid. Squeeze in lime at the end<br><br>
