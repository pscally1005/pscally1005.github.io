Description: A bean salad is a great side to a meal, or a dip for chips and vegetables. It's simple, healthy, and requires no cooking. Just chopping and draining
Instructions: 
- Finely dice your onion, and add to a bowl with cold water. Let the onion soak for 5-10 minutes as you prepare everything else. This removes some of the harsh flavors of the raw onion<br><br>

- Drain and rinse your cans of beans, and add to a large bowl. Here I'm using a 15.5 oz can each of chickpeas, black beans, and light red kidney beans, but any other bean will work as well<br><br>

- Finely dice the pepper and tomatoes, and add to the bowl with the beans. Drain your onion, and add that as well. Crumble the feta on top<br><br>

- In a large glass, mix together the dressing ingredients - olive oil, lemon, balsamic vinegar apple cider vinegar, mustard, minced garlic, basil, thyme, pepper, and salt<br><br>
