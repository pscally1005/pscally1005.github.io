Description: These tomato chickpea wraps are inspired by Indian Chana Masala, but made much simpler and easier for you to easily make for yourself for a weekday lunch. Serve on a tortilla or with a side of rice.
Instructions: 
- Cook the rice in a medium pot according to directions, about 25 minutes. Or serve with tortillas instead<br><br>

- Meanwhile, dice onions small and add it to 12‚Äù pan with some oil, salt, and minced garlic.  Cook over medium heat for 5 minutes, covered<br><br>

- Pour in the tomatoes and chilies. Drain and rinse the chickpeas, and dump those in too. Season with paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and black pepper<br><br>

- Pour some water in the cans of peppers/tomatoes, about halfway up the cans, and rinse them out into the pan, enough to slightly cover all the food<br><br>

- Let simmer on medium for 25 minutes until thickened, uncovered<br><br>

- Squeeze in some lemon juice and dash in some red pepper flakes. Taste for salt if needed. Serve over rice or in a tortilla
