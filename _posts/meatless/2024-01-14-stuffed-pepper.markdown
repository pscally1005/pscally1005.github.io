Description: Stuffed peppers are a great game day appetizer or side. They're best served warm, so get them while you can. I like to have mine with a side of meatloaf or chili. They're vegetarian and gluten free too.
Instructions: 
- Add rice and water to a small pot with water. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce to a simmer. Cook until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed<br><br>

- Meanwhile, prepare the peppers and the filling. Preheat your oven to 350F, and line an 8" baking pan with foil. Cut the tops off the peppers, and scoop out the ribs and seeds. Place the cut peppers in the pan<br><br>

- To a bowl, combine half the feta, the rice, and the rest of the mix ingredients - (drained and rinsed) beans, crushed tomatoes, feta, (finely diced) onion, minced garlic, chili powder, and ground cumin<br><br>

- Evenly divide the filling among the peppers, and top with the remaining feta cheese. I only made half, so I used some glass containers to fill in the spaces so the peppers can still stand up<br><br>

- Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover, and bake for an additional 20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the peppers are tender<br><br>
