Description: Here are 3 methods that I commonly use for making spaghetti squash - oven (my preferred), crockpot, or instant pot. Spaghetti squash is such a versatile vegetable, since it can either be seasoned however you want, or mixed with any of your favorite pasta sauces.
Instructions: 
- <br><u>Crockpot</u><br>
- Rinse squash, dry, prick with a fork, and cover and cook for 3-4 hours on low for a 4-5 pound squash. Be careful not to overcook, or it will be mush (been there before lol)<br><br>

- Mix wit your desired seasonings, and serve<br><br>

- <u>Oven</u><br>
- Microwave squash for 5 minutes (stop halfway to flip over) to soften it up, to make it easier to cut<br><br>

- Cut in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds, and sprinkle your seasonings inside<br><br>

- Flip upside down, and bake for about 45 minutes at 400F on lined cookie sheet with aluminum foil<br><br>

- Fluff with a fork when done onto a plate or into a bowl. Season to taste<br><br>

- <u>Instant Pot</u><br>
- Cut spaghetti squash in half crosswise. Microwave to soften before if needed. Scoop out the seeds<br><br>

- Add ½-1 cup water to the base of the pot and place in the steamer grate. Place spaghetti squash on top of the grate. Set to sealing and pressure cook for 9 minutes on Vegetable Steam. Let pressure naturally release for 5 minutes before manually releasing. Cook in 2 batches if it doesn’t fit<br><br>

- Scrape and fluff with a fork in a bowl, season, and serve<br><br>

- Slice in half, and let steam out before eating. Optionally, top with a small pinch of salt
