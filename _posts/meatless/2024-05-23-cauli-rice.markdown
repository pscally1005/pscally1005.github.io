Description: Cauliflower rice is a super easy and quick low carb side that is very versatile.  Like rice, cauliflower is bland, meaning it will taste like whatever you put on it.  I went for a little garlic and allspice here, and garnished with some parsley for a delicious side in just 10 minutes
Instructions: 
- Preheat a large pan over medium heat with EVOO<br><br>

- Add your cauliflower florets to a food processor.  I used a pound of frozen cauliflower that I defrosted, but fresh will work too.  Pulse a couple of times to chop it to a rice consistency, but be careful not to overblend.  Here's what it should look like<br><br>

- Remove the blade from the food processor, and mix in the spices with a spatula.  Transfer to your heated pan<br><br>

- Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes with occasional stirring.  The rice should become very lightly crispy and browned, like the texture of rice.  Don't mix too much or it will become mushy.  Adjust with spices to taste, garnish with parsley, and serve
