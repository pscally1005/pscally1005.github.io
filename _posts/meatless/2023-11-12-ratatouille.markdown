Description: This simple Ratatouille is a stewed dish of various vegetables in a tomato sauce. This is my preferred way to make this dish, as it's way simpler like this, but feel free to make it look pretty like in the movie.
Instructions: 
- Preheat the oven to 350F<br><br>

- Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the (finely diced) onion, garlic, and salt. Cook, stirring often until the onion has softened, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, dice the pepper (medium dice)<br><br>

- Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, cut the rest of the vegetables (medium dice). Pour in the crushed tomatoes and season (basil, garlic and onion powder, and black pepper)<br><br>

- Add the vegetables (zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and tomatoes) into the pan. Bake at 350F for 60 minutes, covered<br><br>

- Remove the cover and continue baking until the vegetables are very soft and the ratatouille is bubbling, another 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened to your liking. Let cool for a few minutes before serving
