Description: This vegetarian Mexican inspired dish mixes together sauteed kale, pinto beans, <a href="bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a>, and is topped with shredded cheese. This goes well with some meatloaf or taco meat as well
Instructions: 
- Chop up veggies. Add vegetables, garlic, and oil to a skillet over medium heat. Cook until onions are translucent.<br><br>

- Add the seasonings to the veggies<br><br>

- Add in the BBQ sauce (I used my <a href="bbq-sauce">Unsweetened BBQ Sauce</a>) and beans to the skillet. Cook over medium heat for a few minutes. Top with shredded cheese
