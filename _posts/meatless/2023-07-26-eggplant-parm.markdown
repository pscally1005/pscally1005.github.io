Description: This eggplant Parm recipe cuts out the unnecessary breading and frying of the eggplant. This not only makes it simpler, but healthier as well without all the added oils (and makes it gluten free too!). This great meatless dish works well as a side or on a sandwich as well.
Instructions: 
- Start by making the sauce if you don't have any already made.  You can also use a can or jar of sauce too<br><br>

- Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Spray 2 sheet pans with oil.<br><br>

- While the sauce simmers, slice the eggplant into 1/4 inch thick slices. Transfer to the prepared pans, it's ok if they overlap. Season with salt.<br><br>

- Bake for 25 minutes, turning halfway through, until eggplant is golden.<br><br>

- Meanwhile, in a medium bowl combine cottage (or ricotta) cheese, parmesean cheese, egg, parsley, onion powder, and garlic powder.  Also add 1/4 cup (30 g) of grated cheese, and reserve the rest for topping.<br><br>

- Layer sauce, eggplant, cottage cheese mix, and mozzarella. Repeat 2 more times. Top with remaining 2 tbsp (15 g) grated cheese<br><br>

- Lower your to 400F.  Cover with foil and bake until cheese is melted and everything is bubbling, about 40 minutes.<br><br>

- Remove the foil, and bake an additional 10 minutes.<br><br>

- Take it out of the oven and let it sit about 10 minutes before cutting.
