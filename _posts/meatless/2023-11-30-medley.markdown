Description: I made some variation of this dish all the time. It goes great as a side, but most often I use this in my morning scrambled eggs. It's spicy, warm, comforting, and filling all in one healthy package
Instructions: 
- Heat a pan on medium heat with olive oil. Cut your onions into a small dice, and add to the pan with salt. Cover and cook until they start to turn translucent, about 5 minutes<br><br>

- As the onions cook, cut up the tomatoes. Add to the pan when the onions are translucent. Cover, and cook an additional 5 minutes or so<br><br>

- Add in the seasonings (chili powder, paprika, onion and garlic powder, cumin, lemon pepper, black pepper, and cayenne pepper) and the chopped spinach. Mix together, cover, and cook over medium heat until the spinach is done to your liking, about 10-20 minutes<br><br>

- Add in the seasonings and the chopped spinach. Mix together, cover, and cook over medium heat until the spinach is done to your likeness, about 10-20 minutes<br><br>

- Stir in the salsa, lemon, and garlic. Taste for additional seasonings, and serve. Here I have some of the vegetable medley with chopped up leftover chicken breast<br><br>
