Description: This sandwich is like having chunky hummus on bread, and is a lunch favorite of mine. No cooking required, and it comes together in just a few minutes. Use some whole wheat bread or protein tortillas, and you have a quick and nutritious lunch for the next few days.
Instructions: 
- Finely chop the onion. Add to a bowl with rest of ingredients (besides the bread lol)<br><br>

- Roughly mash with a fork or potato masher<br><br>

- Form into 3 sandwiches, and wrap in aluminum foil
