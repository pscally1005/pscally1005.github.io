Description: Baked Sweet Potatoes are possibly the easiest side to a meal of all time. Just prick it with a fork, wrap it, and bake it. They're great on their own, not even needing any spices if you don't want any. Sweet potatoes are a great source of fiber and vitamin A, and help you in feeling full. For my other stable carb side, check out some rice and beans<br><p><a href="rice-and-beans">Classic Rice and Beans</a></p>
Instructions: 
- Wash your sweet potato, and prick it a few times with a fork. Wrap in aluminum foil, and air fry at 400F for 45 minutes<br><br>

- Slice in half, and let steam out before eating. Optionally, top with a small pinch of salt<br><br>
