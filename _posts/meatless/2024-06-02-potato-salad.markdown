Description: This recipe is essentially the exact same as my <a href="mediterranean-pasta-salad">Mediterranean Pasta Salad</a>, but I've just swapped the chickpea pasta for roasted sweet potatoes. They're sweeter (duh) but more importantly cheaper than chickpea pasta, but with less protein. You can't go wrong with either one!
Instructions: 
- Start with the potatoes first, since they'll take the longest. Preheat your oven to 425F, and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Wash and cut your sweet potatoes into small cubes, and add to the sheet. Drizzle with oil and add a pinch of salt. Roast for about 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly charred<br><br>

- Now onto the peppers. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Cut the peppers into long thin strips, and add to the sheet. Drizzle with oil and add a pinch of salt. Roast for about 25 minutes, or until soft and lightly charred. The potatoes and peppers should finish around the same time. Alternatively, you can use a (drained and rinsed) jar of roasted red peppers<br><br>

- As the potatoes and peppers roast, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Drain and rinse your can of chickpeas, and add to a large bowl. Cut up your tomatoes (small dice), cucumber (thin quarters), and spinach/arugula (rough chop). 1 pint of halved cherry tomatoes would work as well. Crumble in the feta cheese<br><br>

- In a small dry pan over medium heat, add the pine nuts and lightly toast for about 3 minutes, until fragrant and lightly browned.  Add to the bowl<br><br>

- Finally, in a large glass, prepare the dressing.  Pour in the apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, and minced garlic.  Add in your spices (basil, thyme, oregano, garlic, onion, lemon pepper, and red pepper flakes).  Stir with a spoon<br><br>

- Pour the dressing over your salad, and serve either cold or warm
