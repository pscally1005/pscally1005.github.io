Description: This simple salad combined grilled or baked eggplant, canned chickpeas, and feta to make a delicious salad for lunch or as a dinner side. This salad also doesn't have any lettuce if you're into that.
Instructions: 
- Wash the eggplant, then slice into 1/2" slices. Lightly salt both side, and let sit for 10 minutes on paper towels. Pat dry<br><br>

- On a grill pan or skillet, cook the eggplant with olive oil over medium heat, flipping occasionally, until fully cooked, about 10-15 minutes. Season with pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder<br><br>

- In a small bowl, mix together the dressing - olive oil, white vinegar, lemon juice, parsely, garlic and onion powder, black pepper, and salt. Pour over the salad<br><br>

- When the eggplant is done, cut into bite sized pieces and mix into the salad. Serve
