Description: Ah rice and beans, the versatile side to nearly every meal. If you've noticed that most of my recipes are just protein+vegetable, this is why. I prefer to keep my carb separate, and that way I can decide if I want to have it or not for dinner. Most of the time when I have a carb on the side, I make some variation of rice and beans, and it's easy, cheap, and pretty healthy as far as grains go. My other go to carb side is a baked sweet potato, so check that out too<br><p><a href="baked-sweet-potato">Baked Sweet Potatoes</a></p>
Instructions: 
- Optionally, you can rinse the rice prior to cooking. This makes the rice drier and fluffier, instead of wet and clumpy (which I honestly prefer ngl, so I don't bother with this). Using a fine mesh strainer, rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.<br><br>

- Add the rice to a medium pot with the water and bouillon powder (or alternatively you can use low sodium broth, or water+1/2 tsp salt). Drain and rinse your beans with a strainer, and add to the pot as well. Here I used a 29 oz can of black beans<br><br>

- When the rice is done, add in the rest of the seasonings (paprika, chili powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder, and black pepper), mix, and adjust to taste. I prefer to add in the beans in the beginning, but can you wait until now to add them as well
